## Judges 2:17 (id: 1807002017)

## Judges 2:18 (id: 1807002018)

## Judges 2:19 (id: 1807002019)

## Judges 2:20 (id: 1807002020)

20The LORD’s anger burned against Israel; and he said, “Because this nation transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to my voice,


## Judges 2:21 (id: 1807002021)

21I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them;

22that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep the LORD’s way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.”


## Judges 2:23 (id: 1807002023)

## Judges 3:1 (id: 1807003001)

1Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;


## Judges 3:2 (id: 1807003002)

2only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of it before:


## Judges 3:3 (id: 1807003003)

3the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.


## Judges 3:4 (id: 1807003004)

4They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the LORD’s commandments, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.


## Judges 3:5 (id: 1807003005)

5The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.


## Judges 3:6 (id: 1807003006)

6They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.


## Judges 3:7 (id: 1807003007)

7The children of Israel did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, and forgot the LORD their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.


## Judges 3:8 (id: 1807003008)

8Therefore the LORD’s anger burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.


## Judges 3:9 (id: 1807003009)

9When the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.


## Judges 3:10 (id: 1807003010)

10The LORD’s Spirit came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and the LORD delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.


## Judges 3:11 (id: 1807003011)

11The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.


## Judges 3:12 (id: 1807003012)

12The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the LORD’s sight.


## Judges 3:13 (id: 1807003013)

13He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.


## Judges 3:14 (id: 1807003014)

14The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.


## Judges 3:15 (id: 1807003015)

15But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a savior for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left\-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.


## Judges 3:16 (id: 1807003016)

16Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.


## Judges 3:17 (id: 1807003017)

17He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.


## Judges 3:18 (id: 1807003018)

18When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.


## Judges 3:19 (id: 1807003019)

19But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him left him.


## Judges 3:20 (id: 1807003020)

20Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.” He arose out of his seat.


## Judges 3:21 (id: 1807003021)

21Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.


## Judges 3:22 (id: 1807003022)

22The handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.


## Judges 3:23 (id: 1807003023)

23Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.


## Judges 3:24 (id: 1807003024)

24After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, “Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room.”


## Judges 3:25 (id: 1807003025)

25They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.


## Judges 3:26 (id: 1807003026)

26Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah.


## Judges 3:27 (id: 1807003027)

27When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.


## Judges 3:28 (id: 1807003028)

28He said to them, “Follow me; for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over.


## Judges 3:29 (id: 1807003029)

29They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valor. No man escaped.


## Judges 3:30 (id: 1807003030)

30So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years.


## Judges 3:31 (id: 1807003031)

31After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel.


## Judges 4:1 (id: 1807004001)

1The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, when Ehud was dead.


## Judges 4:2 (id: 1807004002)

2The LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.


## Judges 4:3 (id: 1807004003)

3The children of Israel cried to the LORD, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years.


## Judges 4:4 (id: 1807004004)

4Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time.


## Judges 4:5 (id: 1807004005)

5She lived under Deborah’s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.


## Judges 4:6 (id: 1807004006)

6She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded, ‘Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?


## Judges 4:7 (id: 1807004007)

7I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’”


## Judges 4:8 (id: 1807004008)

8Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”


## Judges 4:9 (id: 1807004009)

9She said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honor; for the LORD will sell Sisera into a woman’s hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.


## Judges 4:10 (id: 1807004010)

10Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him.


## Judges 4:11 (id: 1807004011)

11Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother\-in\-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.


## Judges 4:12 (id: 1807004012)

12They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.


## Judges 4:13 (id: 1807004013)

13Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.


## Judges 4:14 (id: 1807004014)

14Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t the LORD gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.


## Judges 4:15 (id: 1807004015)

15The LORD confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet.


## Judges 4:16 (id: 1807004016)

16But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.


## Judges 4:17 (id: 1807004017)

17However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.


## Judges 4:18 (id: 1807004018)

18Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.


## Judges 4:19 (id: 1807004019)

19He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.” She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him.


## Judges 4:20 (id: 1807004020)

20He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’”


## Judges 4:21 (id: 1807004021)

21Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died.


## Judges 4:22 (id: 1807004022)

22Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.


## Judges 4:23 (id: 1807004023)

23So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day.


## Judges 4:24 (id: 1807004024)

24The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.


## Judges 5:1 (id: 1807005001)

1Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,


## Judges 5:2 (id: 1807005002)

2“Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people offered themselves willingly, be blessed, LORD!


## Judges 5:3 (id: 1807005003)

3“Hear, you kings! Give ear, you princes! I, even I, will sing to the LORD. I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.


## Judges 5:4 (id: 1807005004)

4“LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the sky also dropped. Yes, the clouds dropped water.


## Judges 5:5 (id: 1807005005)

5The mountains quaked at the LORD’s presence, even Sinai at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.


## Judges 5:6 (id: 1807005006)

6“In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied. The travelers walked through byways.


## Judges 5:7 (id: 1807005007)

7The rulers ceased in Israel. They ceased until I, Deborah, arose; Until I arose a mother in Israel.


## Judges 5:8 (id: 1807005008)

8They chose new gods. Then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?


## Judges 5:9 (id: 1807005009)

9My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless the LORD!


## Judges 5:10 (id: 1807005010)

10“Speak, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.


## Judges 5:11 (id: 1807005011)

11Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there they will rehearse the LORD’s righteous acts, the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. “Then the LORD’s people went down to the gates.


## Judges 5:12 (id: 1807005012)

12‘Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.’


## Judges 5:13 (id: 1807005013)

13“Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down. The LORD came down for me against the mighty.


## Judges 5:14 (id: 1807005014)

14Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you, Benjamin, among your peoples. Governors come down out of Machir. Those who handle the marshal’s staff came out of Zebulun.


## Judges 5:15 (id: 1807005015)

15The princes of Issachar were with Deborah. As was Issachar, so was Barak. They rushed into the valley at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart.


## Judges 5:16 (id: 1807005016)

## Judges 6:28 (id: 1807006028)

39Gideon said to God, “Don’t let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.”


## Judges 6:40 (id: 1807006040)

40God did so that night; for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.


## Judges 7:1 (id: 1807007001)

1Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. Midian’s camp was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.


## Judges 7:2 (id: 1807007002)

2The LORD said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel brag against me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’


## Judges 7:3 (id: 1807007003)

## Judges 7:4 (id: 1807007004)

4The LORD said to Gideon, “There are still too many people. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. It shall be, that those whom I tell you, ‘This shall go with you,’ shall go with you; and whoever I tell you, ‘This shall not go with you,’ shall not go.”


## Judges 7:5 (id: 1807007005)

5So he brought down the people to the water; and the LORD said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.”


## Judges 7:6 (id: 1807007006)

6The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.


## Judges 7:7 (id: 1807007007)

7The LORD said to Gideon, “I will save you by the three hundred men who lapped, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, each to his own place.”


## Judges 7:8 (id: 1807007008)

8So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of the men of Israel to their own tents, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.


## Judges 7:9 (id: 1807007009)

9That same night, the LORD said to him, “Arise, go down into the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.


## Judges 7:10 (id: 1807007010)

10But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp.


## Judges 7:11 (id: 1807007011)

11You will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp.” Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.


## Judges 7:12 (id: 1807007012)

12The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude.


## Judges 7:13 (id: 1807007013)

13When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. He said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.”


## Judges 7:14 (id: 1807007014)

14His fellow answered, “This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian into his hand, with all the army.”


## Judges 7:15 (id: 1807007015)

15It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped. Then he returned into the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the LORD has delivered the army of Midian into your hand!”


## Judges 7:16 (id: 1807007016)

16He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.


## Judges 7:17 (id: 1807007017)

17He said to them, “Watch me, and do likewise. Behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do.


## Judges 7:18 (id: 1807007018)

18When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’”


## Judges 7:19 (id: 1807007019)

19So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch. Then they blew the trumpets and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.


## Judges 7:20 (id: 1807007020)

20The three companies blew the trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they shouted, “The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!”


## Judges 7:21 (id: 1807007021)

21They each stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.


## Judges 7:22 (id: 1807007022)

22They blew the three hundred trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.


## Judges 7:23 (id: 1807007023)

23The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued Midian.


## Judges 7:24 (id: 1807007024)

24Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian and take the waters before them as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan!” So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.


## Judges 7:25 (id: 1807007025)

25They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at Oreb’s rock, and Zeeb they killed at Zeeb’s wine press, as they pursued Midian. Then they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.


## Judges 8:1 (id: 1807008001)

1The men of Ephraim said to him, “Why have you treated us this way, that you didn’t call us when you went to fight with Midian?” They rebuked him sharply.


## Judges 8:2 (id: 1807008002)

2He said to them, “What have I now done in comparison with you? Isn’t the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?


## Judges 8:3 (id: 1807008003)

3God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that.


## Judges 8:4 (id: 1807008004)

4Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.


## Judges 8:5 (id: 1807008005)

5He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”


## Judges 8:6 (id: 1807008006)

6The princes of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”


## Judges 8:7 (id: 1807008007)

7Gideon said, “Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”


## Judges 8:8 (id: 1807008008)

8He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.


## Judges 8:9 (id: 1807008009)

9He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.”

## Judges 8:11 (id: 1807008011)

11Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army; for the army felt secure.


## Judges 8:12 (id: 1807008012)

## Judges 8:14 (id: 1807008014)

14He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, seventy\-seven men.


## Judges 8:15 (id: 1807008015)

15He came to the men of Succoth, and said, “See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’”


## Judges 8:16 (id: 1807008016)

16He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.


## Judges 8:17 (id: 1807008017)

17He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.


## Judges 8:18 (id: 1807008018)

18Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” They answered, “They were like you. They all resembled the children of a king.”


## Judges 8:19 (id: 1807008019)

19He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.”


## Judges 8:20 (id: 1807008020)

20He said to Jether his firstborn, “Get up and kill them!” But the youth didn’t draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.


## Judges 8:21 (id: 1807008021)

21Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “You rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.


## Judges 8:22 (id: 1807008022)

23Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. The LORD shall rule over you.”


## Judges 8:24 (id: 1807008024)

24Gideon said to them, “I do have a request: that you would each give me the earrings of his plunder.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)


## Judges 8:25 (id: 1807008025)

25They answered, “We will willingly give them.” They spread a garment, and every man threw the earrings of his plunder into it.


## Judges 8:26 (id: 1807008026)

26The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, in addition to the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and in addition to the chains that were about their camels’ necks.


## Judges 8:27 (id: 1807008027)

27Gideon made an ephod out of it, and put it in Ophrah, his city. Then all Israel played the prostitute with it there; and it became a snare to Gideon and to his house.

33As soon as Gideon was dead, the children of Israel turned again and played the prostitute following the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god.


## Judges 8:34 (id: 1807008034)

34The children of Israel didn’t remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;

## Judges 9:3 (id: 1807009003)

16but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh,


## Judges 11:17 (id: 1807011017)

17then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me pass through your land;’ but the king of Edom didn’t listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab, but he refused; so Israel stayed in Kadesh.


## Judges 11:18 (id: 1807011018)

18Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.

20But Sihon didn’t trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.


## Judges 11:21 (id: 1807011021)

21The LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.

22They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.


## Judges 11:23 (id: 1807011023)

23So now the LORD, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?

## Judges 12:3 (id: 1807012003)

## Judges 12:4 (id: 1807012004)

## Judges 12:5 (id: 1807012005)

4Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any unclean thing;


## Judges 13:5 (id: 1807013005)

5for, behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall come on his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. He shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.”


## Judges 13:6 (id: 1807013006)

6Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name;


## Judges 13:7 (id: 1807013007)

7but he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink. Don’t eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’”


## Judges 13:8 (id: 1807013008)

8Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, “Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us, and teach us what we should do to the child who shall be born.”


## Judges 13:9 (id: 1807013009)

9God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah, her husband, wasn’t with her.


## Judges 13:10 (id: 1807013010)

10The woman hurried and ran, and told her husband, saying to him, “Behold, the man who came to me that day has appeared to me.”


## Judges 13:11 (id: 1807013011)

11Manoah arose and followed his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” He said, “I am.”


## Judges 13:12 (id: 1807013012)

12Manoah said, “Now let your words happen. What shall the child’s way of life and mission be?”


## Judges 13:13 (id: 1807013013)

13The LORD’s angel said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.


## Judges 13:14 (id: 1807013014)

14She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. Let her observe all that I commanded her.”


## Judges 13:15 (id: 1807013015)

15Manoah said to the LORD’s angel, “Please stay with us, that we may make a young goat ready for you.”


## Judges 13:16 (id: 1807013016)

16The LORD’s angel said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I won’t eat your bread. If you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD.” For Manoah didn’t know that he was the LORD’s angel.


## Judges 13:17 (id: 1807013017)

17Manoah said to the LORD’s angel, “What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?”


## Judges 13:18 (id: 1807013018)

18The LORD’s angel said to him, “Why do you ask about my name, since it is incomprehensible?”


## Judges 13:19 (id: 1807013019)

19So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to the LORD. Then the angel did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.


## Judges 13:20 (id: 1807013020)

20For when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, the LORD’s angel ascended in the flame of the altar. Manoah and his wife watched; and they fell on their faces to the ground.


## Judges 13:21 (id: 1807013021)

21But the LORD’s angel didn’t appear to Manoah or to his wife any more. Then Manoah knew that he was the LORD’s angel.


## Judges 13:22 (id: 1807013022)

22Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God.”


## Judges 13:23 (id: 1807013023)

23But his wife said to him, “If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he wouldn’t have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, and he wouldn’t have shown us all these things, nor would he have told us such things as these at this time.”


## Judges 13:24 (id: 1807013024)

24The woman bore a son and named him Samson. The child grew, and the LORD blessed him.


## Judges 13:25 (id: 1807013025)

25The LORD’s Spirit began to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.


## Judges 14:1 (id: 1807014001)

1Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.


## Judges 14:2 (id: 1807014002)

2He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as my wife.”


## Judges 14:3 (id: 1807014003)

3Then his father and his mother said to him, “Isn’t there a woman among your brothers’ daughters, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?” Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.”


## Judges 14:4 (id: 1807014004)

4But his father and his mother didn’t know that it was of the LORD; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.


## Judges 14:5 (id: 1807014005)

5Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and his mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion roared at him.


## Judges 14:6 (id: 1807014006)

6The LORD’s Spirit came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat with his bare hands, but he didn’t tell his father or his mother what he had done.


## Judges 14:7 (id: 1807014007)

7He went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.


## Judges 14:8 (id: 1807014008)

8After a while he returned to take her, and he went over to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.


## Judges 14:9 (id: 1807014009)

9He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. He came to his father and mother and gave to them, and they ate, but he didn’t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion’s body.


## Judges 14:10 (id: 1807014010)

10His father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men used to do so.


## Judges 14:11 (id: 1807014011)

11When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.


## Judges 14:12 (id: 1807014012)

12Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can tell me the answer within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;


## Judges 14:13 (id: 1807014013)

13but if you can’t tell me the answer, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.” They said to him, “Tell us your riddle, that we may hear it.”


## Judges 14:14 (id: 1807014014)

14He said to them, “Out of the eater came out food. Out of the strong came out sweetness.” They couldn’t in three days declare the riddle.


## Judges 14:15 (id: 1807014015)

15On the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Isn’t that so?”


## Judges 14:16 (id: 1807014016)

16Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You just hate me, and don’t love me. You’ve told a riddle to the children of my people, and haven’t told it to me.” He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told my father or my mother, so why should I tell you?”


## Judges 14:17 (id: 1807014017)

17She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and on the seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.


## Judges 14:18 (id: 1807014018)

18The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” He said to them, “If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer, you wouldn’t have found out my riddle.”


## Judges 14:19 (id: 1807014019)

19The LORD’s Spirit came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck thirty men of them. He took their plunder, then gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle. His anger burned, and he went up to his father’s house.


## Judges 14:20 (id: 1807014020)

20But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his friend.


## Judges 15:1 (id: 1807015001)

1But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. He said, “I will go in to my wife’s room.” But her father wouldn’t allow him to go in.


## Judges 15:2 (id: 1807015002)

2Her father said, “I most certainly thought that you utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please, take her instead.”


## Judges 15:3 (id: 1807015003)

3Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in the case of the Philistines when I harm them.”


## Judges 15:4 (id: 1807015004)

4Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the middle between every two tails.


## Judges 15:5 (id: 1807015005)

5When he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.


## Judges 15:6 (id: 1807015006)

6Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” They said, “Samson, the son\-in\-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” The Philistines came up, and burned her and her father with fire.


## Judges 15:7 (id: 1807015007)

7Samson said to them, “If you behave like this, surely I will take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.”


## Judges 15:8 (id: 1807015008)

8He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cave in Etam’s rock.


## Judges 15:9 (id: 1807015009)

9Then the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.


## Judges 15:10 (id: 1807015010)

10The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”


## Judges 15:11 (id: 1807015011)

11Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in Etam’s rock, and said to Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”


## Judges 15:12 (id: 1807015012)

12They said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.”


## Judges 15:13 (id: 1807015013)

13They spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will bind you securely and deliver you into their hands; but surely we will not kill you.” They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.


## Judges 15:14 (id: 1807015014)

14When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. Then the LORD’s Spirit came mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burned with fire; and his bands dropped from off his hands.


## Judges 15:15 (id: 1807015015)

15He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, put out his hand, took it, and struck a thousand men with it.


## Judges 15:16 (id: 1807015016)

16Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.”


## Judges 15:17 (id: 1807015017)

17When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.


## Judges 15:18 (id: 1807015018)

18He was very thirsty, and called on the LORD and said, “You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”


## Judges 15:19 (id: 1807015019)

19But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.


## Judges 15:20 (id: 1807015020)

20He judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.


## Judges 16:1 (id: 1807016001)

1Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went in to her.


## Judges 16:2 (id: 1807016002)

2The Gazites were told, “Samson is here!” They surrounded him and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, “Wait until morning light; then we will kill him.”


## Judges 16:3 (id: 1807016003)

3Samson lay until midnight, then arose at midnight and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city, with the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.


## Judges 16:4 (id: 1807016004)

4It came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.


## Judges 16:5 (id: 1807016005)

5The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, “Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”


## Judges 16:6 (id: 1807016006)

6Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and what you might be bound to afflict you.”


## Judges 16:7 (id: 1807016007)

7Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.”


## Judges 16:8 (id: 1807016008)

8Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.


## Judges 16:9 (id: 1807016009)

9Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He broke the cords as a flax thread is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.


## Judges 16:10 (id: 1807016010)

10Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies. Now please tell me how you might be bound.”


## Judges 16:11 (id: 1807016011)

11He said to her, “If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.”


## Judges 16:12 (id: 1807016012)

12So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, then said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread.


## Judges 16:13 (id: 1807016013)

13Delilah said to Samson, “Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound.” He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the fabric on the loom.”


## Judges 16:14 (id: 1807016014)

14She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam and the fabric.


## Judges 16:15 (id: 1807016015)

15She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.”


## Judges 16:16 (id: 1807016016)

16When she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, his soul was troubled to death.


## Judges 16:17 (id: 1807016017)

17He told her all his heart and said to her, “No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me and I will become weak, and be like any other man.”


## Judges 16:18 (id: 1807016018)

18When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand.


## Judges 16:19 (id: 1807016019)

19She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.


## Judges 16:20 (id: 1807016020)

20She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” He awoke out of his sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free.” But he didn’t know that the LORD had departed from him.


## Judges 16:21 (id: 1807016021)

21The Philistines laid hold on him and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he ground at the mill in the prison.


## Judges 16:22 (id: 1807016022)

22However, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.


## Judges 16:23 (id: 1807016023)

23The lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.”


## Judges 16:24 (id: 1807016024)

24When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, “Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand.”


## Judges 16:25 (id: 1807016025)

25When their hearts were merry, they said, “Call for Samson, that he may entertain us.” They called for Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars;


## Judges 16:26 (id: 1807016026)

26and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, “Allow me to feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean on them.”


## Judges 16:27 (id: 1807016027)

27Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson performed.


## Judges 16:28 (id: 1807016028)

28Samson called to the LORD, and said, “Lord GOD, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.”


## Judges 16:29 (id: 1807016029)

29Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested and leaned on them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left.


## Judges 16:30 (id: 1807016030)

30Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life.


## Judges 16:31 (id: 1807016031)

31Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty years.


## Judges 17:1 (id: 1807017001)

1There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.


## Judges 17:2 (id: 1807017002)

2He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears—behold, the silver is with me. I took it.” His mother said, “May the LORD bless my son!”


## Judges 17:3 (id: 1807017003)

3He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, then his mother said, “I most certainly dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.”


## Judges 17:4 (id: 1807017004)

4When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah.


## Judges 17:5 (id: 1807017005)

5The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.


## Judges 17:6 (id: 1807017006)

6In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.


## Judges 17:7 (id: 1807017007)

7There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.


## Judges 17:8 (id: 1807017008)

8The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he traveled.


## Judges 17:9 (id: 1807017009)

9Micah said to him, “Where did you come from?” He said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live.”


## Judges 17:10 (id: 1807017010)

10Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.” So the Levite went in.


## Judges 17:11 (id: 1807017011)

11The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.


## Judges 17:12 (id: 1807017012)

12Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.


## Judges 17:13 (id: 1807017013)

13Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will do good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest.”


## Judges 18:1 (id: 1807018001)

1In those days there was no king in Israel. In those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.


## Judges 18:2 (id: 1807018002)

2The children of Dan sent five men of their family from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it. They said to them, “Go, explore the land!” They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.


## Judges 18:3 (id: 1807018003)

3When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; so they went over there and said to him, “Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?”


## Judges 18:4 (id: 1807018004)

4He said to them, “Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”


## Judges 18:5 (id: 1807018005)

5They said to him, “Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.”


## Judges 18:6 (id: 1807018006)

6The priest said to them, “Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before the LORD.”


## Judges 18:7 (id: 1807018007)

7Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in safety, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone else.


## Judges 18:8 (id: 1807018008)

8They came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brothers asked them, “What do you say?”


## Judges 18:9 (id: 1807018009)

9They said, “Arise, and let’s go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Do you stand still? Don’t be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.


## Judges 18:10 (id: 1807018010)

10When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”


## Judges 18:11 (id: 1807018011)

11The family of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol with six hundred men armed with weapons of war.


## Judges 18:12 (id: 1807018012)

12They went up and encamped in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day. Behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.


## Judges 18:13 (id: 1807018013)

13They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.


## Judges 18:14 (id: 1807018014)

14Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brothers, “Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a carved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do.”


## Judges 18:15 (id: 1807018015)

15They went over there and came to the house of the young Levite man, even to the house of Micah, and asked him how he was doing.


## Judges 18:16 (id: 1807018016)

16The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.


## Judges 18:17 (id: 1807018017)

17The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.


## Judges 18:18 (id: 1807018018)

18When these went into Micah’s house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”


## Judges 18:19 (id: 1807018019)

19They said to him, “Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us. Be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”


## Judges 18:20 (id: 1807018020)

20The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people.


## Judges 18:21 (id: 1807018021)

21So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them.


## Judges 18:22 (id: 1807018022)

22When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.


## Judges 18:23 (id: 1807018023)

23As they called to the children of Dan, they turned their faces, and said to Micah, “What ails you, that you come with such a company?”


## Judges 18:24 (id: 1807018024)

24He said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away! What more do I have? How can you ask me, ‘What ails you?’”


## Judges 18:25 (id: 1807018025)

25The children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.”


## Judges 18:26 (id: 1807018026)

26The children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.


## Judges 18:27 (id: 1807018027)

27They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they burned the city with fire.


## Judges 18:28 (id: 1807018028)

28There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city and lived in it.


## Judges 18:29 (id: 1807018029)

29They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; however the name of the city used to be Laish.


## Judges 18:30 (id: 1807018030)

30The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.


## Judges 18:31 (id: 1807018031)

31So they set up for themselves Micah’s engraved image which he made, and it remained all the time that God’s house was in Shiloh.


## Judges 19:1 (id: 1807019001)

1In those days, when there was no king in Israel, there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah.


## Judges 19:2 (id: 1807019002)

2His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to Bethlehem Judah, and was there for four months.


## Judges 19:3 (id: 1807019003)

3Her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him and a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.


## Judges 19:4 (id: 1807019004)

4His father\-in\-law, the young lady’s father, kept him there; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank, and stayed there.


## Judges 19:5 (id: 1807019005)

5On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart. The young lady’s father said to his son\-in\-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.”


## Judges 19:6 (id: 1807019006)

6So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together. Then the young lady’s father said to the man, “Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.”


## Judges 19:7 (id: 1807019007)

7The man rose up to depart; but his father\-in\-law urged him, and he stayed there again.


## Judges 19:8 (id: 1807019008)

8He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady’s father said, “Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines;” and they both ate.


## Judges 19:9 (id: 1807019009)

9When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father\-in\-law, the young lady’s father, said to him, “Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay all night. Behold, the day is ending. Stay here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early, that you may go home.”


## Judges 19:10 (id: 1807019010)

10But the man wouldn’t stay that night, but he rose up and went near Jebus (also called Jerusalem). With him were a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him.


## Judges 19:11 (id: 1807019011)

11When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Please come and let’s enter into this city of the Jebusites, and stay in it.”


## Judges 19:12 (id: 1807019012)

12His master said to him, “We won’t enter into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.”


## Judges 19:13 (id: 1807019013)

13He said to his servant, “Come and let’s draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.”


## Judges 19:14 (id: 1807019014)

14So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.


## Judges 19:15 (id: 1807019015)

15They went over there, to go in to stay in Gibeah. He went in, and sat down in the street of the city; for there was no one who took them into his house to stay.


## Judges 19:16 (id: 1807019016)

16Behold, an old man came from his work out of the field at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he lived in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.


## Judges 19:17 (id: 1807019017)

17He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”


## Judges 19:18 (id: 1807019018)

18He said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem Judah. I am going to the LORD’s house; and there is no one who has taken me into his house.


## Judges 19:19 (id: 1807019019)

19Yet there is both straw and feed for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your servant, and for the young man who is with your servants. There is no lack of anything.”


## Judges 19:20 (id: 1807019020)

20The old man said, “Peace be to you! Just let me supply all your needs, but don’t sleep in the street.”


## Judges 19:21 (id: 1807019021)

21So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder. Then they washed their feet, and ate and drank.


## Judges 19:22 (id: 1807019022)

22As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain wicked fellows, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house, that we can have sex with him!”


## Judges 19:23 (id: 1807019023)

23The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, “No, my brothers, please don’t act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, don’t do this folly.


## Judges 19:24 (id: 1807019024)

24Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them what seems good to you; but to this man don’t do any such folly.”


## Judges 19:25 (id: 1807019025)

25But the men wouldn’t listen to him; so the man grabbed his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her all night until the morning. When the day began to dawn, they let her go.


## Judges 19:26 (id: 1807019026)

26Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, until it was light.


## Judges 19:27 (id: 1807019027)

27Her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.


## Judges 19:28 (id: 1807019028)

28He said to her, “Get up, and let’s get going!” but no one answered. Then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.


## Judges 19:29 (id: 1807019029)

29When he had come into his house, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.


## Judges 19:30 (id: 1807019030)

30It was so, that all who saw it said, “Such a deed has not been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day! Consider it, take counsel, and speak.”


## Judges 20:1 (id: 1807020001)

1Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD at Mizpah.


## Judges 20:2 (id: 1807020002)

2The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.


## Judges 20:3 (id: 1807020003)

3(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?”


## Judges 20:4 (id: 1807020004)

4The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, “I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.


## Judges 20:5 (id: 1807020005)

5The men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house by night. They intended to kill me and they raped my concubine, and she is dead.


## Judges 20:6 (id: 1807020006)

6I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.


## Judges 20:7 (id: 1807020007)

7Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.”


## Judges 20:8 (id: 1807020008)

8All the people arose as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us turn to his house.


## Judges 20:9 (id: 1807020009)

9But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;


## Judges 20:10 (id: 1807020010)

10and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that the men of Gibeah have done in Israel.”


## Judges 20:11 (id: 1807020011)

11So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.


## Judges 20:12 (id: 1807020012)

12The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What wickedness is this that has happened among you?


## Judges 20:13 (id: 1807020013)

13Now therefore deliver up the men, the wicked fellows who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel.” But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel.


## Judges 20:14 (id: 1807020014)

## Judges 20:23 (id: 1807020023)

23The children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening; and they asked of the LORD, saying, “Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?” The LORD said, “Go up against him.”


## Judges 20:24 (id: 1807020024)

## Judges 20:28 (id: 1807020028)

28and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?” The LORD said, “Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand.”


## Judges 20:29 (id: 1807020029)

## Judges 20:32 (id: 1807020032)

## Judges 20:33 (id: 1807020033)

## Judges 20:35 (id: 1807020035)

35The LORD struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty\-five thousand one hundred men. All these drew the sword.


## Judges 20:36 (id: 1807020036)

36So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck, for the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.


## Judges 20:37 (id: 1807020037)

37The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.


## Judges 20:38 (id: 1807020038)

38Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.


## Judges 20:39 (id: 1807020039)

39The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, “Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.”


## Judges 20:40 (id: 1807020040)

4On the next day, the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.


## Judges 21:5 (id: 1807021005)

5The children of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up in the assembly to the LORD?” For they had made a great oath concerning him who didn’t come up to the LORD to Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”

## Judges 21:9 (id: 1807021009)

9For when the people were counted, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.


## Judges 21:10 (id: 1807021010)

10The congregation sent twelve thousand of the most valiant men there, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.


## Judges 21:11 (id: 1807021011)

11This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain with a man.”


## Judges 21:12 (id: 1807021012)

12They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.

13The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.

18However, we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”


## Judges 21:19 (id: 1807021019)

19They said, “Behold, there is a feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.”

## Judges 21:21 (id: 1807021021)

21and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.


## Judges 21:22 (id: 1807021022)

22It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us, because we didn’t take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them; otherwise you would now be guilty.’”


## Judges 21:23 (id: 1807021023)

23The children of Benjamin did so, and took wives for themselves according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.


## Judges 21:24 (id: 1807021024)

24The children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they each went out from there to his own inheritance.


## Judges 21:25 (id: 1807021025)

25In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.
