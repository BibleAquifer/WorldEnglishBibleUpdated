## Philemon 1:1 (id: 1857001001)

1Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,


## Philemon 1:2 (id: 1857001002)

2to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:


## Philemon 1:3 (id: 1857001003)

3Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


## Philemon 1:4 (id: 1857001004)

4I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,


## Philemon 1:5 (id: 1857001005)

5hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,


## Philemon 1:6 (id: 1857001006)

6that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.


## Philemon 1:7 (id: 1857001007)

7For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.


## Philemon 1:8 (id: 1857001008)

8Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,


## Philemon 1:9 (id: 1857001009)

9yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.


## Philemon 1:10 (id: 1857001010)

10I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains,


## Philemon 1:11 (id: 1857001011)

11who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.


## Philemon 1:12 (id: 1857001012)

12I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,


## Philemon 1:13 (id: 1857001013)

13whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.


## Philemon 1:14 (id: 1857001014)

14But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.


## Philemon 1:15 (id: 1857001015)

15For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever,


## Philemon 1:16 (id: 1857001016)

16no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.


## Philemon 1:17 (id: 1857001017)

17If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.


## Philemon 1:18 (id: 1857001018)

18But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.


## Philemon 1:19 (id: 1857001019)

19I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).


## Philemon 1:20 (id: 1857001020)

20Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.


## Philemon 1:21 (id: 1857001021)

21Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.


## Philemon 1:22 (id: 1857001022)

22Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.


## Philemon 1:23 (id: 1857001023)

23Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,


## Philemon 1:24 (id: 1857001024)

24as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.


## Philemon 1:25 (id: 1857001025)

25The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
