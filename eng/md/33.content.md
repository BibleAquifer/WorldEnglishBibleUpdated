## Micah 1:2 (id: 1833001002)

2Hear, you peoples, all of you! Listen, O earth, and all that is therein. Let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.

## Micah 1:5 (id: 1833001005)

5“All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the disobedience of Jacob? Isn’t it Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Aren’t they Jerusalem?


## Micah 1:6 (id: 1833001006)

6Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field, like places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down its stones into the valley, and I will uncover its foundations.

7All her idols will be beaten to pieces, all her temple gifts will be burned with fire, and I will destroy all her images; for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them, and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.”


## Micah 1:8 (id: 1833001008)

8For this I will lament and wail. I will go stripped and naked. I will howl like the jackals and mourn like the ostriches.

## Micah 1:11 (id: 1833001011)

11Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame. The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out. The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection.

12For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, because evil has come down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.

## Micah 2:4 (id: 1833002004)

4In that day they will take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, ‘We are utterly ruined! My people’s possession is divided up. Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’”

10Arise, and depart! For this is not your resting place, because of uncleanness that destroys, even with a grievous destruction.


## Micah 2:11 (id: 1833002011)

11If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying, “I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,” he would be the prophet of this people.


## Micah 2:12 (id: 1833002012)

## Micah 2:13 (id: 1833002013)

2You who hate the good, and love the evil; who tear off their skin, and their flesh from off their bones;


## Micah 3:3 (id: 1833003003)

3who also eat the flesh of my people, and peel their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as meat within the cauldron.


## Micah 3:4 (id: 1833003004)

4Then they will cry to the LORD, but he will not answer them. Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, because they made their deeds evil.”


## Micah 3:5 (id: 1833003005)

5The LORD says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray—for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him:


## Micah 3:6 (id: 1833003006)

8But as for me, I am full of power by the LORD’s Spirit, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his disobedience, and to Israel his sin.


## Micah 3:9 (id: 1833003009)

9Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice, and pervert all equity,


## Micah 3:10 (id: 1833003010)

10who build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.


## Micah 3:11 (id: 1833003011)

11Her leaders judge for bribes, and her priests teach for a price, and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money; yet they lean on the LORD, and say, “Isn’t the LORD among us? No disaster will come on us.”


## Micah 3:12 (id: 1833003012)

12Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.


## Micah 4:1 (id: 1833004001)

1But in the latter days, it will happen that the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills; and peoples will stream to it.


## Micah 4:2 (id: 1833004002)

2Many nations will go and say, “Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” For the law will go out of Zion, and the LORD’s word from Jerusalem;


## Micah 4:3 (id: 1833004003)

3and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war any more.


## Micah 4:4 (id: 1833004004)

4But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree. No one will make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of Armies has spoken.


## Micah 4:5 (id: 1833004005)

5Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.


## Micah 4:6 (id: 1833004006)

6“In that day,” says the LORD, “I will assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;


## Micah 4:7 (id: 1833004007)

7and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”


## Micah 4:8 (id: 1833004008)

8You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come. Yes, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.


## Micah 4:9 (id: 1833004009)

9Now why do you cry out aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?


## Micah 4:10 (id: 1833004010)

10Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now you will go out of the city, and will dwell in the field, and will come even to Babylon. There you will be rescued. There the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.


## Micah 4:11 (id: 1833004011)

11Now many nations have assembled against you, that say, “Let her be defiled, and let our eye gloat over Zion.”


## Micah 4:12 (id: 1833004012)

12But they don’t know the thoughts of the LORD, neither do they understand his counsel; for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.


## Micah 4:13 (id: 1833004013)

13Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze. You will beat in pieces many peoples. I will devote their gain to the LORD, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.


## Micah 5:1 (id: 1833005001)

## Micah 5:3 (id: 1833005003)

3Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth. Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel.

## Micah 5:8 (id: 1833005008)

8The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, among many peoples, like a lion among the animals of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there is no one to deliver.


## Micah 5:9 (id: 1833005009)

3My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me!

4For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.


## Micah 6:5 (id: 1833006005)

## Micah 6:6 (id: 1833006006)

6How shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?


## Micah 6:7 (id: 1833006007)

7Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams? With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?


## Micah 6:8 (id: 1833006008)

8He has shown you, O man, what is good. What does the LORD require of you, but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?


## Micah 6:9 (id: 1833006009)

9The LORD’s voice calls to the city— and wisdom fears your name— “Listen to the rod, and he who appointed it.


## Micah 6:10 (id: 1833006010)

## Micah 6:14 (id: 1833006014)

14You shall eat, but not be satisfied. Your hunger will be within you. You will store up, but not save, and that which you save I will give up to the sword.


## Micah 6:15 (id: 1833006015)

15You will sow, but won’t reap. You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil; and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine.


## Micah 6:16 (id: 1833006016)

16For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of Ahab’s house. You walk in their counsels, that I may make you a ruin, and your inhabitants a hissing. You will bear the reproach of my people.”


## Micah 7:1 (id: 1833007001)

1Misery is mine! Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard. There is no cluster of grapes to eat. My soul desires to eat the early fig.


## Micah 7:2 (id: 1833007002)

2The godly man has perished out of the earth, and there is no one upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; every man hunts his brother with a net.


## Micah 7:3 (id: 1833007003)

3Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently. The ruler and judge ask for a bribe. The powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul. Thus they conspire together.


## Micah 7:4 (id: 1833007004)

4The best of them is like a brier. The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, even your visitation, has come; now is the time of their confusion.


## Micah 7:5 (id: 1833007005)

5Don’t trust in a neighbor. Don’t put confidence in a friend. With the woman lying in your embrace, be careful of the words of your mouth!


## Micah 7:6 (id: 1833007006)

6For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter\-in\-law against her mother\-in\-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.


## Micah 7:7 (id: 1833007007)

7But as for me, I will look to the LORD. I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.


## Micah 7:8 (id: 1833007008)

8Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy. When I fall, I will arise. When I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.


## Micah 7:9 (id: 1833007009)

9I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he pleads my case and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light. I will see his righteousness.


## Micah 7:10 (id: 1833007010)

10Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will see her. Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.


## Micah 7:11 (id: 1833007011)

11A day to build your walls! In that day, he will extend your boundary.


## Micah 7:12 (id: 1833007012)

12In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.


## Micah 7:13 (id: 1833007013)

13Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.


## Micah 7:14 (id: 1833007014)

14Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your heritage, who dwell by themselves in a forest. Let them feed in the middle of fertile pasture land, in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.


## Micah 7:15 (id: 1833007015)

15“As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things.”


## Micah 7:16 (id: 1833007016)

16The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might. They will lay their hand on their mouth. Their ears will be deaf.


## Micah 7:17 (id: 1833007017)

17They will lick the dust like a serpent. Like crawling things of the earth, they will come trembling out of their dens. They will come with fear to the LORD our God, and will be afraid because of you.


## Micah 7:18 (id: 1833007018)

18Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity, and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? He doesn’t retain his anger forever, because he delights in loving kindness.


## Micah 7:19 (id: 1833007019)

19He will again have compassion on us. He will tread our iniquities under foot. You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.


## Micah 7:20 (id: 1833007020)

20You will give truth to Jacob, and mercy to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
