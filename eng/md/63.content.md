## 2 John 1:1 (id: 1863001001)

1The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,


## 2 John 1:2 (id: 1863001002)

2for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:


## 2 John 1:3 (id: 1863001003)

3Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.


## 2 John 1:4 (id: 1863001004)

4I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.


## 2 John 1:5 (id: 1863001005)

5Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.


## 2 John 1:6 (id: 1863001006)

6This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.


## 2 John 1:7 (id: 1863001007)

7For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.


## 2 John 1:8 (id: 1863001008)

8Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.


## 2 John 1:9 (id: 1863001009)

9Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.


## 2 John 1:10 (id: 1863001010)

10If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,


## 2 John 1:11 (id: 1863001011)

11for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.


## 2 John 1:12 (id: 1863001012)

12Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.


## 2 John 1:13 (id: 1863001013)

13The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
