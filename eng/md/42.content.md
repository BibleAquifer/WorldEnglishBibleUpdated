## Luke 1:1 (id: 1842001001)

1Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,


## Luke 1:2 (id: 1842001002)

2even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,


## Luke 1:3 (id: 1842001003)

3it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;


## Luke 1:4 (id: 1842001004)

4that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.


## Luke 1:5 (id: 1842001005)

5There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.


## Luke 1:6 (id: 1842001006)

6They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.


## Luke 1:7 (id: 1842001007)

7But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.


## Luke 1:8 (id: 1842001008)

8Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division


## Luke 1:9 (id: 1842001009)

9according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.


## Luke 1:10 (id: 1842001010)

10The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.


## Luke 1:11 (id: 1842001011)

11An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.


## Luke 1:12 (id: 1842001012)

12Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.


## Luke 1:13 (id: 1842001013)

13But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.


## Luke 1:14 (id: 1842001014)

14You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.


## Luke 1:15 (id: 1842001015)

15For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.


## Luke 1:16 (id: 1842001016)

16He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.


## Luke 1:17 (id: 1842001017)

17He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.”


## Luke 1:18 (id: 1842001018)

18Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”


## Luke 1:19 (id: 1842001019)

19The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.


## Luke 1:20 (id: 1842001020)

20Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”


## Luke 1:21 (id: 1842001021)

21The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.


## Luke 1:22 (id: 1842001022)

22When he came out, he could not speak to them. They perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.


## Luke 1:23 (id: 1842001023)

23When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.


## Luke 1:24 (id: 1842001024)

24After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,


## Luke 1:25 (id: 1842001025)

25“Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men.”


## Luke 1:26 (id: 1842001026)

26Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,


## Luke 1:27 (id: 1842001027)

27to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary.


## Luke 1:28 (id: 1842001028)

28Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!”


## Luke 1:29 (id: 1842001029)

29But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.


## Luke 1:30 (id: 1842001030)

30The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.


## Luke 1:31 (id: 1842001031)

31Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Jesus.’


## Luke 1:32 (id: 1842001032)

32He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,


## Luke 1:33 (id: 1842001033)

33and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”


## Luke 1:34 (id: 1842001034)

34Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”


## Luke 1:35 (id: 1842001035)

35The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.


## Luke 1:36 (id: 1842001036)

36Behold, Elizabeth your relative also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.


## Luke 1:37 (id: 1842001037)

37For nothing spoken by God is impossible.”


## Luke 1:38 (id: 1842001038)

38Mary said, “Behold, the servant of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.


## Luke 1:39 (id: 1842001039)

39Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,


## Luke 1:40 (id: 1842001040)

40and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.


## Luke 1:41 (id: 1842001041)

41When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.


## Luke 1:42 (id: 1842001042)

42She called out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!


## Luke 1:43 (id: 1842001043)

43Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?


## Luke 1:44 (id: 1842001044)

44For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!


## Luke 1:45 (id: 1842001045)

45Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!”


## Luke 1:46 (id: 1842001046)

46Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord.


## Luke 1:47 (id: 1842001047)

47My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,


## Luke 1:48 (id: 1842001048)

48for he has looked at the humble state of his servant. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.


## Luke 1:49 (id: 1842001049)

49For he who is mighty has done great things for me. Holy is his name.


## Luke 1:50 (id: 1842001050)

50His mercy is for generations and generations on those who fear him.


## Luke 1:51 (id: 1842001051)

51He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.


## Luke 1:52 (id: 1842001052)

52He has put down princes from their thrones, and has exalted the lowly.


## Luke 1:53 (id: 1842001053)

53He has filled the hungry with good things. He has sent the rich away empty.


## Luke 1:54 (id: 1842001054)

54He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,


## Luke 1:55 (id: 1842001055)

55as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his offspring forever.”


## Luke 1:56 (id: 1842001056)

56Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house.


## Luke 1:57 (id: 1842001057)

57Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son.


## Luke 1:58 (id: 1842001058)

58Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.


## Luke 1:59 (id: 1842001059)

59On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.


## Luke 1:60 (id: 1842001060)

60His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.”


## Luke 1:61 (id: 1842001061)

61They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”


## Luke 1:62 (id: 1842001062)

62They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.


## Luke 1:63 (id: 1842001063)

63He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.” They all marveled.


## Luke 1:64 (id: 1842001064)

64His mouth was opened immediately and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.


## Luke 1:65 (id: 1842001065)

65Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.


## Luke 1:66 (id: 1842001066)

66All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him.


## Luke 1:67 (id: 1842001067)

67His father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,


## Luke 1:68 (id: 1842001068)

68“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people;


## Luke 1:69 (id: 1842001069)

69and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David


## Luke 1:70 (id: 1842001070)

70(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),


## Luke 1:71 (id: 1842001071)

71salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;


## Luke 1:72 (id: 1842001072)

72to show mercy toward our fathers, to remember his holy covenant,


## Luke 1:73 (id: 1842001073)

73the oath which he swore to Abraham our father,


## Luke 1:74 (id: 1842001074)

74to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve him without fear,


## Luke 1:75 (id: 1842001075)

75in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.


## Luke 1:76 (id: 1842001076)

76And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,


## Luke 1:77 (id: 1842001077)

77to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,


## Luke 1:78 (id: 1842001078)

78because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the dawn from on high will visit us,


## Luke 1:79 (id: 1842001079)

79to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace.”


## Luke 1:80 (id: 1842001080)

80The child was growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.


## Luke 2:1 (id: 1842002001)

1Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.


## Luke 2:2 (id: 1842002002)

2This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.


## Luke 2:3 (id: 1842002003)

3All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.


## Luke 2:4 (id: 1842002004)

4Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,


## Luke 2:5 (id: 1842002005)

5to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.


## Luke 2:6 (id: 1842002006)

6While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth.


## Luke 2:7 (id: 1842002007)

7She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.


## Luke 2:8 (id: 1842002008)

8There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.


## Luke 2:9 (id: 1842002009)

9Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.


## Luke 2:10 (id: 1842002010)

10The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.


## Luke 2:11 (id: 1842002011)

11For there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.


## Luke 2:12 (id: 1842002012)

12This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”


## Luke 2:13 (id: 1842002013)

13Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God and saying,


## Luke 2:14 (id: 1842002014)

14“Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men.”


## Luke 2:15 (id: 1842002015)

15When the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”


## Luke 2:16 (id: 1842002016)

16They came with haste and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.


## Luke 2:17 (id: 1842002017)

17When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.


## Luke 2:18 (id: 1842002018)

18All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.


## Luke 2:19 (id: 1842002019)

19But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.


## Luke 2:20 (id: 1842002020)

20The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.


## Luke 2:21 (id: 1842002021)

21When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.


## Luke 2:22 (id: 1842002022)

22When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord


## Luke 2:23 (id: 1842002023)

23(as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),


## Luke 2:24 (id: 1842002024)

24and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”


## Luke 2:25 (id: 1842002025)

25Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.


## Luke 2:26 (id: 1842002026)

26It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.


## Luke 2:27 (id: 1842002027)

27He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,


## Luke 2:28 (id: 1842002028)

28then he received him into his arms and blessed God, and said,


## Luke 2:29 (id: 1842002029)

29“Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to your word, in peace;


## Luke 2:30 (id: 1842002030)

30for my eyes have seen your salvation,


## Luke 2:31 (id: 1842002031)

31which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;


## Luke 2:32 (id: 1842002032)

32a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel.”


## Luke 2:33 (id: 1842002033)

33Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him.


## Luke 2:34 (id: 1842002034)

34Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.


## Luke 2:35 (id: 1842002035)

35Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”


## Luke 2:36 (id: 1842002036)

36There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,


## Luke 2:37 (id: 1842002037)

37and she had been a widow for about eighty\-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day.


## Luke 2:38 (id: 1842002038)

38Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.


## Luke 2:39 (id: 1842002039)

39When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.


## Luke 2:40 (id: 1842002040)

40The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.


## Luke 2:41 (id: 1842002041)

41His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.


## Luke 2:42 (id: 1842002042)

42When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast;


## Luke 2:43 (id: 1842002043)

43and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it,


## Luke 2:44 (id: 1842002044)

44but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.


## Luke 2:45 (id: 1842002045)

45When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.


## Luke 2:46 (id: 1842002046)

46After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.


## Luke 2:47 (id: 1842002047)

47All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.


## Luke 2:48 (id: 1842002048)

48When they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.”


## Luke 2:49 (id: 1842002049)

49He said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”


## Luke 2:50 (id: 1842002050)

50They didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them.


## Luke 2:51 (id: 1842002051)

51And he went down with them and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.


## Luke 2:52 (id: 1842002052)

52And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.


## Luke 3:1 (id: 1842003001)

1Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,


## Luke 3:2 (id: 1842003002)

2during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.


## Luke 3:3 (id: 1842003003)

3He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.


## Luke 3:4 (id: 1842003004)

4As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.


## Luke 3:5 (id: 1842003005)

5Every valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth.


## Luke 3:6 (id: 1842003006)

6All flesh will see God’s salvation.’”


## Luke 3:7 (id: 1842003007)

7He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?


## Luke 3:8 (id: 1842003008)

8Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!


## Luke 3:9 (id: 1842003009)

9Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”


## Luke 3:10 (id: 1842003010)

10The multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?”


## Luke 3:11 (id: 1842003011)

11He answered them, “He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.”


## Luke 3:12 (id: 1842003012)

12Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must we do?”


## Luke 3:13 (id: 1842003013)

13He said to them, “Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.”


## Luke 3:14 (id: 1842003014)

14Soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?” He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.”


## Luke 3:15 (id: 1842003015)

15As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,


## Luke 3:16 (id: 1842003016)

16John answered them all, “I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.


## Luke 3:17 (id: 1842003017)

17His winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”


## Luke 3:18 (id: 1842003018)

18Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,


## Luke 3:19 (id: 1842003019)

19but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,


## Luke 3:20 (id: 1842003020)

20added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.


## Luke 3:21 (id: 1842003021)

21Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized and was praying. The sky was opened,


## Luke 3:22 (id: 1842003022)

22and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.”

2for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.


## Luke 4:3 (id: 1842004003)

3The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”

4Jesus answered him, saying, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’”

5The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I want.


## Luke 4:7 (id: 1842004007)

7If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.”

8Jesus answered him, “Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”


## Luke 4:9 (id: 1842004009)

9He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,

10for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’

13When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.


## Luke 4:14 (id: 1842004014)

14Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area.


## Luke 4:15 (id: 1842004015)

15He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.


## Luke 4:16 (id: 1842004016)

16He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.


## Luke 4:17 (id: 1842004017)

17The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,


## Luke 4:18 (id: 1842004018)

18“The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recoveringof sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,


## Luke 4:19 (id: 1842004019)

19and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”


## Luke 4:20 (id: 1842004020)

20He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.


## Luke 4:21 (id: 1842004021)

21He began to tell them, “Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”


## Luke 4:22 (id: 1842004022)

22All testified about him and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”


## Luke 4:23 (id: 1842004023)

23He said to them, “Doubtlessyou will tell me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.’”


## Luke 4:24 (id: 1842004024)

24He said, “Most certainlyI tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.


## Luke 4:25 (id: 1842004025)

25But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.


## Luke 4:26 (id: 1842004026)

26Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.


## Luke 4:27 (id: 1842004027)

27There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.”


## Luke 4:28 (id: 1842004028)

28They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things.


## Luke 4:29 (id: 1842004029)

29They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff.


## Luke 4:30 (id: 1842004030)

30But he, passing through the middle of them, went his way.


## Luke 4:31 (id: 1842004031)

31He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,


## Luke 4:32 (id: 1842004032)

32and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.


## Luke 4:33 (id: 1842004033)

33In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,


## Luke 4:34 (id: 1842004034)

34saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!”


## Luke 4:35 (id: 1842004035)

35Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no harm.


## Luke 4:36 (id: 1842004036)

36Amazement came on all and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”


## Luke 4:37 (id: 1842004037)

37News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.


## Luke 4:38 (id: 1842004038)

38He rose up from the synagogue and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother\-in\-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him to help her.


## Luke 4:39 (id: 1842004039)

39He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.


## Luke 4:40 (id: 1842004040)

40When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.


## Luke 4:41 (id: 1842004041)

41Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.


## Luke 4:42 (id: 1842004042)

42When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them.


## Luke 4:43 (id: 1842004043)

43But he said to them, “I must preach the good news of God’s Kingdom to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.”


## Luke 4:44 (id: 1842004044)

44He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.


## Luke 5:1 (id: 1842005001)

1Now while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.


## Luke 5:2 (id: 1842005002)

2He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.


## Luke 5:3 (id: 1842005003)

3He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.


## Luke 5:4 (id: 1842005004)

4When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”


## Luke 5:5 (id: 1842005005)

5Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”


## Luke 5:6 (id: 1842005006)

6When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.


## Luke 5:7 (id: 1842005007)

7They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.


## Luke 5:8 (id: 1842005008)

8But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”


## Luke 5:9 (id: 1842005009)

9For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;


## Luke 5:10 (id: 1842005010)

10and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”


## Luke 5:11 (id: 1842005011)

11When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.


## Luke 5:12 (id: 1842005012)

12While he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”


## Luke 5:13 (id: 1842005013)

13He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy left him.


## Luke 5:14 (id: 1842005014)

14He commanded him to tell no one, “But go your way and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”


## Luke 5:15 (id: 1842005015)

15But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.


## Luke 5:16 (id: 1842005016)

16But he withdrew himself into the desert and prayed.


## Luke 5:17 (id: 1842005017)

17On one of those days, he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.


## Luke 5:18 (id: 1842005018)

18Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.


## Luke 5:19 (id: 1842005019)

19Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before Jesus.


## Luke 5:20 (id: 1842005020)

20Seeing their faith, he said to him, “Man,your sins are forgiven you.”


## Luke 5:21 (id: 1842005021)

21The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”


## Luke 5:22 (id: 1842005022)

22But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, “Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?


## Luke 5:23 (id: 1842005023)

23Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk’?


## Luke 5:24 (id: 1842005024)

24But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, arise, take up your cot, and go to your house.”


## Luke 5:25 (id: 1842005025)

25Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.


## Luke 5:26 (id: 1842005026)

26Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today.”


## Luke 5:27 (id: 1842005027)

27After these things he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, “Follow me!”


## Luke 5:28 (id: 1842005028)

28He left everything, and rose up and followed him.


## Luke 5:29 (id: 1842005029)

29Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.


## Luke 5:30 (id: 1842005030)

30Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”


## Luke 5:31 (id: 1842005031)

31Jesus answered them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.


## Luke 5:32 (id: 1842005032)

32I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”


## Luke 5:33 (id: 1842005033)

33They said to him, “Why do John’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?”


## Luke 5:34 (id: 1842005034)

34He said to them, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?


## Luke 5:35 (id: 1842005035)

35But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.”


## Luke 5:36 (id: 1842005036)

36He also told a parable to them. “No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.


## Luke 5:37 (id: 1842005037)

37No one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed.


## Luke 5:38 (id: 1842005038)

38Butnew wine must be put into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved.


## Luke 5:39 (id: 1842005039)

39No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”


## Luke 6:1 (id: 1842006001)

1Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.


## Luke 6:2 (id: 1842006002)

2But some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?”


## Luke 6:3 (id: 1842006003)

3Jesus, answering them, said, “Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him,


## Luke 6:4 (id: 1842006004)

4how he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”


## Luke 6:5 (id: 1842006005)

5He said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”


## Luke 6:6 (id: 1842006006)

6It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.


## Luke 6:7 (id: 1842006007)

7The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.


## Luke 6:8 (id: 1842006008)

8But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Rise up and stand in the middle.” He arose and stood.


## Luke 6:9 (id: 1842006009)

9Then Jesus said to them, “I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”


## Luke 6:10 (id: 1842006010)

10He looked around at them all, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.


## Luke 6:11 (id: 1842006011)

11But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.


## Luke 6:12 (id: 1842006012)

12In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.


## Luke 6:13 (id: 1842006013)

13When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:


## Luke 6:14 (id: 1842006014)

14Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;


## Luke 6:15 (id: 1842006015)

15Matthew; Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot;


## Luke 6:16 (id: 1842006016)

16Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.


## Luke 6:17 (id: 1842006017)

17He came down with them and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,


## Luke 6:18 (id: 1842006018)

18as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits; and they were being healed.


## Luke 6:19 (id: 1842006019)

19All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all.


## Luke 6:20 (id: 1842006020)

20He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said: “Blessed are you who are poor, for God’s Kingdom is yours.


## Luke 6:21 (id: 1842006021)

21Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.


## Luke 6:22 (id: 1842006022)

22Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.


## Luke 6:23 (id: 1842006023)

23Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.


## Luke 6:24 (id: 1842006024)

24“But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.


## Luke 6:25 (id: 1842006025)

25Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.


## Luke 6:26 (id: 1842006026)

26Woe, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.


## Luke 6:27 (id: 1842006027)

27“But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,


## Luke 6:28 (id: 1842006028)

28bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.


## Luke 6:29 (id: 1842006029)

29To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also.


## Luke 6:30 (id: 1842006030)

30Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.


## Luke 6:31 (id: 1842006031)

31“As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.


## Luke 6:32 (id: 1842006032)

32“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.


## Luke 6:33 (id: 1842006033)

33If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.


## Luke 6:34 (id: 1842006034)

34If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.


## Luke 6:35 (id: 1842006035)

35But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.


## Luke 6:36 (id: 1842006036)

36“Thereforebe merciful, even as your Father is also merciful.


## Luke 6:37 (id: 1842006037)

37Don’tjudge, and you won’t be judged. Don’tcondemn, and you won’t be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free.


## Luke 6:38 (id: 1842006038)

38“Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you.”


## Luke 6:39 (id: 1842006039)

39He spoke a parable to them. “Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both fall into a pit?


## Luke 6:40 (id: 1842006040)

40A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.


## Luke 6:41 (id: 1842006041)

41Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye?


## Luke 6:42 (id: 1842006042)

42Or how can you tell your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye.


## Luke 6:43 (id: 1842006043)

43“For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor again a rotten tree that produces good fruit.


## Luke 6:44 (id: 1842006044)

44For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.


## Luke 6:45 (id: 1842006045)

45The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.


## Luke 6:46 (id: 1842006046)

46“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and don’t do the things which I say?


## Luke 6:47 (id: 1842006047)

47Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words and does them, I will show you who he is like.


## Luke 6:48 (id: 1842006048)

48He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.


## Luke 6:49 (id: 1842006049)

49But he who hears and doesn’t do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.”

3When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.


## Luke 7:4 (id: 1842007004)

4When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him,


## Luke 7:5 (id: 1842007005)

5for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”


## Luke 7:6 (id: 1842007006)

6Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.


## Luke 7:7 (id: 1842007007)

7Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.


## Luke 7:8 (id: 1842007008)

8For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”


## Luke 7:9 (id: 1842007009)

9When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”


## Luke 7:10 (id: 1842007010)

11Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.


## Luke 7:12 (id: 1842007012)

12Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only born son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.


## Luke 7:13 (id: 1842007013)

13When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, “Don’t cry.”


## Luke 7:14 (id: 1842007014)

14He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I tell you, arise!”


## Luke 7:15 (id: 1842007015)

15He who was dead sat up and began to speak. Then he gave him to his mother.


## Luke 7:16 (id: 1842007016)

16Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited his people!”


## Luke 7:17 (id: 1842007017)

17This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region.


## Luke 7:18 (id: 1842007018)

18The disciples of John told him about all these things.


## Luke 7:19 (id: 1842007019)

19John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?”


## Luke 7:20 (id: 1842007020)

20When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’”


## Luke 7:21 (id: 1842007021)

21In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.


## Luke 7:22 (id: 1842007022)

22Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.


## Luke 7:23 (id: 1842007023)

23Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”


## Luke 7:24 (id: 1842007024)

24When John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?


## Luke 7:25 (id: 1842007025)

25But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed and live delicately are in kings’ courts.


## Luke 7:26 (id: 1842007026)

26But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.


## Luke 7:27 (id: 1842007027)

27This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’


## Luke 7:28 (id: 1842007028)

28“For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.”


## Luke 7:29 (id: 1842007029)

29When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism.


## Luke 7:30 (id: 1842007030)

30But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.


## Luke 7:31 (id: 1842007031)

31“To what then should I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?


## Luke 7:32 (id: 1842007032)

32They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’


## Luke 7:33 (id: 1842007033)

33For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’


## Luke 7:34 (id: 1842007034)

34The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’


## Luke 7:35 (id: 1842007035)

35Wisdom is justified by all her children.”


## Luke 7:36 (id: 1842007036)

36One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house and sat at the table.


## Luke 7:37 (id: 1842007037)

37Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment.


## Luke 7:38 (id: 1842007038)

38Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.


## Luke 7:39 (id: 1842007039)

39Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner.”


## Luke 7:40 (id: 1842007040)

40Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” He said, “Teacher, say on.”


## Luke 7:41 (id: 1842007041)

41“A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.


## Luke 7:42 (id: 1842007042)

42When they couldn’t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?”


## Luke 7:43 (id: 1842007043)

43Simon answered, “He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.” He said to him, “You have judged correctly.”


## Luke 7:44 (id: 1842007044)

44Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.


## Luke 7:45 (id: 1842007045)

45You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.


## Luke 7:46 (id: 1842007046)

46You didn’t anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.


## Luke 7:47 (id: 1842007047)

47Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.”


## Luke 7:48 (id: 1842007048)

48He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”


## Luke 7:49 (id: 1842007049)

49Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”


## Luke 7:50 (id: 1842007050)

50He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”


## Luke 8:1 (id: 1842008001)

1Soon afterwards, he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of God’s Kingdom. With him were the twelve,


## Luke 8:2 (id: 1842008002)

2and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;


## Luke 8:3 (id: 1842008003)

3and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others who served them from their possessions.


## Luke 8:4 (id: 1842008004)

4When a great multitude came together and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable:


## Luke 8:5 (id: 1842008005)

5“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.


## Luke 8:6 (id: 1842008006)

6Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.


## Luke 8:7 (id: 1842008007)

7Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it.


## Luke 8:8 (id: 1842008008)

8Other fell into the good ground and grew and produced one hundred times as much fruit.” As he said these things, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”


## Luke 8:9 (id: 1842008009)

9Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”


## Luke 8:10 (id: 1842008010)

10He said, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but to the rest it is given in parables, that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’


## Luke 8:11 (id: 1842008011)

11“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.


## Luke 8:12 (id: 1842008012)

12Those along the road are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.


## Luke 8:13 (id: 1842008013)

13Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.


## Luke 8:14 (id: 1842008014)

14What fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life; and they bring no fruit to maturity.


## Luke 8:15 (id: 1842008015)

15Those in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.


## Luke 8:16 (id: 1842008016)

16“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.


## Luke 8:17 (id: 1842008017)

17For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.


## Luke 8:18 (id: 1842008018)

18Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”


## Luke 8:19 (id: 1842008019)

19His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.


## Luke 8:20 (id: 1842008020)

20Some people told him, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.”


## Luke 8:21 (id: 1842008021)

21But he answered them, “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”


## Luke 8:22 (id: 1842008022)

22Now on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.


## Luke 8:23 (id: 1842008023)

23But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.


## Luke 8:24 (id: 1842008024)

24They came to him and awoke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are dying!” He awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; then they ceased, and it was calm.


## Luke 8:25 (id: 1842008025)

25He said to them, “Where is your faith?” Being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, “Who is this then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”


## Luke 8:26 (id: 1842008026)

26Then they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.


## Luke 8:27 (id: 1842008027)

27When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.


## Luke 8:28 (id: 1842008028)

28When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”


## Luke 8:29 (id: 1842008029)

29For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.


## Luke 8:30 (id: 1842008030)

30Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.


## Luke 8:31 (id: 1842008031)

31They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.


## Luke 8:32 (id: 1842008032)

32Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. Then he allowed them.


## Luke 8:33 (id: 1842008033)

33The demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.


## Luke 8:34 (id: 1842008034)

34When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.


## Luke 8:35 (id: 1842008035)

35People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.


## Luke 8:36 (id: 1842008036)

36Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.


## Luke 8:37 (id: 1842008037)

37All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. Then he entered into the boat and returned.


## Luke 8:38 (id: 1842008038)

38But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,


## Luke 8:39 (id: 1842008039)

39“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.


## Luke 8:40 (id: 1842008040)

40When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.


## Luke 8:41 (id: 1842008041)

41Behold, a man named Jairus came. He was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged him to come into his house,


## Luke 8:42 (id: 1842008042)

42for he had an only born daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.


## Luke 8:43 (id: 1842008043)

43A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians and could not be healed by any,


## Luke 8:44 (id: 1842008044)

44came behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. Immediately the flow of her blood stopped.


## Luke 8:45 (id: 1842008045)

45Jesus said, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”


## Luke 8:46 (id: 1842008046)

46But Jesus said, “Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”


## Luke 8:47 (id: 1842008047)

47When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.


## Luke 8:48 (id: 1842008048)

48He said to her, “Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”


## Luke 8:49 (id: 1842008049)

49While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”


## Luke 8:50 (id: 1842008050)

50But Jesus hearing it, answered him, “Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”


## Luke 8:51 (id: 1842008051)

51When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.


## Luke 8:52 (id: 1842008052)

52All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, “Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”


## Luke 8:53 (id: 1842008053)

53They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.


## Luke 8:54 (id: 1842008054)

54But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, “Child, arise!”


## Luke 8:55 (id: 1842008055)

55Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.


## Luke 8:56 (id: 1842008056)

56Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.


## Luke 9:1 (id: 1842009001)

1He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.


## Luke 9:2 (id: 1842009002)

2He sent them out to preach God’s Kingdom and to heal the sick.


## Luke 9:3 (id: 1842009003)

3He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey—no staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money. Don’t have two tunics each.


## Luke 9:4 (id: 1842009004)

4Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.


## Luke 9:5 (id: 1842009005)

5As many as don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”


## Luke 9:6 (id: 1842009006)

6They departed and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News and healing everywhere.


## Luke 9:7 (id: 1842009007)

7Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,


## Luke 9:8 (id: 1842009008)

8and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.


## Luke 9:9 (id: 1842009009)

9Herod said, “I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him.


## Luke 9:10 (id: 1842009010)

10The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done. He took them and withdrew apart to a desert region of a city called Bethsaida.


## Luke 9:11 (id: 1842009011)

11But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing.


## Luke 9:12 (id: 1842009012)

12The day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms and lodge and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”


## Luke 9:13 (id: 1842009013)

13But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”


## Luke 9:14 (id: 1842009014)

14For they were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, “Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”


## Luke 9:15 (id: 1842009015)

15They did so, and made them all sit down.


## Luke 9:16 (id: 1842009016)

16He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.


## Luke 9:17 (id: 1842009017)

17They ate and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.


## Luke 9:18 (id: 1842009018)

18As he was praying alone, the disciples were near him, and he asked them, “Who do the multitudes say that I am?”


## Luke 9:19 (id: 1842009019)

19They answered, “‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets has risen again.”


## Luke 9:20 (id: 1842009020)

20He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”


## Luke 9:21 (id: 1842009021)

21But he warned them and commanded them to tell this to no one,


## Luke 9:22 (id: 1842009022)

22saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”


## Luke 9:23 (id: 1842009023)

23He said to all, “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.


## Luke 9:24 (id: 1842009024)

24For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake will save it.


## Luke 9:25 (id: 1842009025)

25For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?


## Luke 9:26 (id: 1842009026)

26For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.


## Luke 9:27 (id: 1842009027)

27But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here who will in no way taste of death until they see God’s Kingdom.”


## Luke 9:28 (id: 1842009028)

28About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.


## Luke 9:29 (id: 1842009029)

29As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.


## Luke 9:30 (id: 1842009030)

30Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,


## Luke 9:31 (id: 1842009031)

31who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.


## Luke 9:32 (id: 1842009032)

32Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.


## Luke 9:33 (id: 1842009033)

33As they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.


## Luke 9:34 (id: 1842009034)

34While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.


## Luke 9:35 (id: 1842009035)

35A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”


## Luke 9:36 (id: 1842009036)

36When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.


## Luke 9:37 (id: 1842009037)

37On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.


## Luke 9:38 (id: 1842009038)

38Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only born child.


## Luke 9:39 (id: 1842009039)

39Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams; and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.


## Luke 9:40 (id: 1842009040)

40I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”


## Luke 9:41 (id: 1842009041)

41Jesus answered, “Faithlessand perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”


## Luke 9:42 (id: 1842009042)

42While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.


## Luke 9:43 (id: 1842009043)

43They were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,


## Luke 9:44 (id: 1842009044)

44“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”


## Luke 9:45 (id: 1842009045)

45But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.


## Luke 9:46 (id: 1842009046)

46An argument arose among them about which of them was the greatest.


## Luke 9:47 (id: 1842009047)

47Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,


## Luke 9:48 (id: 1842009048)

48and said to them, “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”


## Luke 9:49 (id: 1842009049)

49John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”


## Luke 9:50 (id: 1842009050)

50Jesus said to him, “Don’tforbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”


## Luke 9:51 (id: 1842009051)

51It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem


## Luke 9:52 (id: 1842009052)

52and sent messengers before his face. They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.


## Luke 9:53 (id: 1842009053)

53They didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set toward Jerusalem.


## Luke 9:54 (id: 1842009054)

54When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”


## Luke 9:55 (id: 1842009055)

55But he turned and rebuked them, “You don’t knowof what kind of spirit you are.


## Luke 9:56 (id: 1842009056)

56For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.” They went to another village.


## Luke 9:57 (id: 1842009057)

57As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”


## Luke 9:58 (id: 1842009058)

58Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”


## Luke 9:59 (id: 1842009059)

59He said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”


## Luke 9:60 (id: 1842009060)

60But Jesus said to him, “Leavethe dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce God’s Kingdom.”


## Luke 9:61 (id: 1842009061)

61Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good\-bye to those who are at my house.”


## Luke 9:62 (id: 1842009062)

62But Jesus said to him, “No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for God’s Kingdom.”


## Luke 10:1 (id: 1842010001)

1Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place where he was about to come.


## Luke 10:2 (id: 1842010002)

2Then he said to them, “The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.


## Luke 10:3 (id: 1842010003)

3Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.


## Luke 10:4 (id: 1842010004)

4Carryno purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.


## Luke 10:5 (id: 1842010005)

5Into whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’


## Luke 10:6 (id: 1842010006)

6If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.


## Luke 10:7 (id: 1842010007)

7Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don’t go from house to house.


## Luke 10:8 (id: 1842010008)

8Into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.


## Luke 10:9 (id: 1842010009)

9Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘God’s Kingdom has come near to you.’


## Luke 10:10 (id: 1842010010)

10But into whatever city you enter and they don’t receive you, go out into its streets and say,


## Luke 10:11 (id: 1842010011)

11‘Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that God’s Kingdom has come near to you.’


## Luke 10:12 (id: 1842010012)

12I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.


## Luke 10:13 (id: 1842010013)

13“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.


## Luke 10:14 (id: 1842010014)

14But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.


## Luke 10:15 (id: 1842010015)

15You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.


## Luke 10:16 (id: 1842010016)

16Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.”


## Luke 10:17 (id: 1842010017)

17The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!”


## Luke 10:18 (id: 1842010018)

18He said to them, “I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.


## Luke 10:19 (id: 1842010019)

19Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you.


## Luke 10:20 (id: 1842010020)

20Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”


## Luke 10:21 (id: 1842010021)

21In that same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well\-pleasing in your sight.”


## Luke 10:22 (id: 1842010022)

22Turning to the disciples, he said, “All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.”


## Luke 10:23 (id: 1842010023)

23Turning to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,


## Luke 10:24 (id: 1842010024)

24for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.”


## Luke 10:25 (id: 1842010025)

25Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”


## Luke 10:26 (id: 1842010026)

26He said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read it?”


## Luke 10:27 (id: 1842010027)

27He answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.”


## Luke 10:28 (id: 1842010028)

28He said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”


## Luke 10:29 (id: 1842010029)

29But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”


## Luke 10:30 (id: 1842010030)

30Jesus answered, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.


## Luke 10:31 (id: 1842010031)

31By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.


## Luke 10:32 (id: 1842010032)

32In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.


## Luke 10:33 (id: 1842010033)

33But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,


## Luke 10:34 (id: 1842010034)

34came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.


## Luke 10:35 (id: 1842010035)

35On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’


## Luke 10:36 (id: 1842010036)

36Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”


## Luke 10:37 (id: 1842010037)

37He said, “He who showed mercy on him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”


## Luke 10:38 (id: 1842010038)

38As they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.


## Luke 10:39 (id: 1842010039)

39She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard his word.


## Luke 10:40 (id: 1842010040)

40But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.”


## Luke 10:41 (id: 1842010041)

41Jesus answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,


## Luke 10:42 (id: 1842010042)

42but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”


## Luke 11:1 (id: 1842011001)

1When he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”


## Luke 11:2 (id: 1842011002)

2He said to them, “When you pray, say, ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come. May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.


## Luke 11:3 (id: 1842011003)

3Give us day by day our daily bread.


## Luke 11:4 (id: 1842011004)

4Forgiveus our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’”


## Luke 11:5 (id: 1842011005)

5He said to them, “Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight and tell him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,


## Luke 11:6 (id: 1842011006)

6for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’


## Luke 11:7 (id: 1842011007)

7and he from within will answer and say, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’?


## Luke 11:8 (id: 1842011008)

8I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.


## Luke 11:9 (id: 1842011009)

9“I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.


## Luke 11:10 (id: 1842011010)

10For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.


## Luke 11:11 (id: 1842011011)

11“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?


## Luke 11:12 (id: 1842011012)

12Or if he asks for an egg, he won’t give him a scorpion, will he?


## Luke 11:13 (id: 1842011013)

13If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”


## Luke 11:14 (id: 1842011014)

14He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.


## Luke 11:15 (id: 1842011015)

15But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”


## Luke 11:16 (id: 1842011016)

16Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.


## Luke 11:17 (id: 1842011017)

17But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.


## Luke 11:18 (id: 1842011018)

18If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.


## Luke 11:19 (id: 1842011019)

19But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.


## Luke 11:20 (id: 1842011020)

20But if I by God’s finger cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come to you.


## Luke 11:21 (id: 1842011021)

21“When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.


## Luke 11:22 (id: 1842011022)

22But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his plunder.


## Luke 11:23 (id: 1842011023)

23“He who is not with me is against me. He who doesn’t gather with me scatters.


## Luke 11:24 (id: 1842011024)

24The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’


## Luke 11:25 (id: 1842011025)

25When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.


## Luke 11:26 (id: 1842011026)

26Then he goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”


## Luke 11:27 (id: 1842011027)

27It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!”


## Luke 11:28 (id: 1842011028)

28But he said, “On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.”


## Luke 11:29 (id: 1842011029)

29When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, “This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.


## Luke 11:30 (id: 1842011030)

30For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will also be to this generation.


## Luke 11:31 (id: 1842011031)

31The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.


## Luke 11:32 (id: 1842011032)

32The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.


## Luke 11:33 (id: 1842011033)

33“No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.


## Luke 11:34 (id: 1842011034)

34The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.


## Luke 11:35 (id: 1842011035)

35Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn’t darkness.


## Luke 11:36 (id: 1842011036)

36If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”


## Luke 11:37 (id: 1842011037)

37Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in and sat at the table.


## Luke 11:38 (id: 1842011038)

38When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.


## Luke 11:39 (id: 1842011039)

39The Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.


## Luke 11:40 (id: 1842011040)

40You foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also?


## Luke 11:41 (id: 1842011041)

41But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.


## Luke 11:42 (id: 1842011042)

42But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and God’s love. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.


## Luke 11:43 (id: 1842011043)

43Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.


## Luke 11:44 (id: 1842011044)

44Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”


## Luke 11:45 (id: 1842011045)

45One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.”


## Luke 11:46 (id: 1842011046)

46He said, “Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.


## Luke 11:47 (id: 1842011047)

47Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.


## Luke 11:48 (id: 1842011048)

48So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.


## Luke 11:49 (id: 1842011049)

49Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,


## Luke 11:50 (id: 1842011050)

50that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation,


## Luke 11:51 (id: 1842011051)

51from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.


## Luke 11:52 (id: 1842011052)

52Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.”


## Luke 11:53 (id: 1842011053)

53As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him,


## Luke 11:54 (id: 1842011054)

54lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.


## Luke 12:1 (id: 1842012001)

1Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, “Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.


## Luke 12:2 (id: 1842012002)

2But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known.


## Luke 12:3 (id: 1842012003)

3Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.


## Luke 12:4 (id: 1842012004)

4“I tell you, my friends, don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.


## Luke 12:5 (id: 1842012005)

5But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear him.


## Luke 12:6 (id: 1842012006)

6“Aren’t five sparrows sold for two assaria coins?Not one of them is forgotten by God.


## Luke 12:7 (id: 1842012007)

7But the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.


## Luke 12:8 (id: 1842012008)

8“I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, the Son of Man will also confess before the angels of God;


## Luke 12:9 (id: 1842012009)

9but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of God’s angels.


## Luke 12:10 (id: 1842012010)

10Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.


## Luke 12:11 (id: 1842012011)

11When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don’t be anxious how or what you will answer or what you will say;


## Luke 12:12 (id: 1842012012)

12for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say.”


## Luke 12:13 (id: 1842012013)

13One of the multitude said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”


## Luke 12:14 (id: 1842012014)

14But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?”


## Luke 12:15 (id: 1842012015)

15He said to them, “Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man’s life doesn’t consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses.”


## Luke 12:16 (id: 1842012016)

16He spoke a parable to them, saying, “The ground of a certain rich man produced abundantly.


## Luke 12:17 (id: 1842012017)

17He reasoned within himself, saying, ‘What will I do, because I don’t have room to store my crops?’


## Luke 12:18 (id: 1842012018)

18He said, ‘This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.


## Luke 12:19 (id: 1842012019)

19I will tell my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.”’


## Luke 12:20 (id: 1842012020)

20“But God said to him, ‘You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared—whose will they be?’


## Luke 12:21 (id: 1842012021)

21So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”


## Luke 12:22 (id: 1842012022)

22He said to his disciples, “Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.


## Luke 12:23 (id: 1842012023)

23Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.


## Luke 12:24 (id: 1842012024)

24Consider the ravens: they don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!


## Luke 12:25 (id: 1842012025)

25Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?


## Luke 12:26 (id: 1842012026)

26If then you aren’t able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?


## Luke 12:27 (id: 1842012027)

27Consider the lilies, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.


## Luke 12:28 (id: 1842012028)

28But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?


## Luke 12:29 (id: 1842012029)

29“Don’tseek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.


## Luke 12:30 (id: 1842012030)

30For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.


## Luke 12:31 (id: 1842012031)

31But seek God’s Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.


## Luke 12:32 (id: 1842012032)

32“Don’t be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.


## Luke 12:33 (id: 1842012033)

33Sell what you have and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn’t fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.


## Luke 12:34 (id: 1842012034)

34For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.


## Luke 12:35 (id: 1842012035)

35“Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning.


## Luke 12:36 (id: 1842012036)

36Be like men watching for their lord when he returns from the wedding feast, that when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.


## Luke 12:37 (id: 1842012037)

37Blessed are those servants whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you that he will dress himself, make them recline, and will come and serve them.


## Luke 12:38 (id: 1842012038)

38They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch and finds them so.


## Luke 12:39 (id: 1842012039)

39But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into.


## Luke 12:40 (id: 1842012040)

40Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”


## Luke 12:41 (id: 1842012041)

41Peter said to him, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?”


## Luke 12:42 (id: 1842012042)

42The Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?


## Luke 12:43 (id: 1842012043)

43Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.


## Luke 12:44 (id: 1842012044)

44Truly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.


## Luke 12:45 (id: 1842012045)

45But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and to be drunken,


## Luke 12:46 (id: 1842012046)

46then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn’t expecting him and in an hour that he doesn’t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.


## Luke 12:47 (id: 1842012047)

47That servant who knew his lord’s will, and didn’t prepare nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,


## Luke 12:48 (id: 1842012048)

48but he who didn’t know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.


## Luke 12:49 (id: 1842012049)

49“I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.


## Luke 12:50 (id: 1842012050)

50But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!


## Luke 12:51 (id: 1842012051)

51Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.


## Luke 12:52 (id: 1842012052)

52For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.


## Luke 12:53 (id: 1842012053)

53They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother\-in\-law against her daughter\-in\-law, and daughter\-in\-law against her mother\-in\-law.”


## Luke 12:54 (id: 1842012054)

54He said to the multitudes also, “When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and so it happens.


## Luke 12:55 (id: 1842012055)

55When a south wind blows, you say, ‘There will be a scorching heat,’ and it happens.


## Luke 12:56 (id: 1842012056)

56You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don’t interpret this time?


## Luke 12:57 (id: 1842012057)

57“Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?


## Luke 12:58 (id: 1842012058)

58For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.


## Luke 12:59 (id: 1842012059)

59I tell you, you will by no means get out of there until you have paid the very last penny.”


## Luke 13:1 (id: 1842013001)

1Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.


## Luke 13:2 (id: 1842013002)

2Jesus answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?


## Luke 13:3 (id: 1842013003)

3I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.


## Luke 13:4 (id: 1842013004)

4Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them—do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?


## Luke 13:5 (id: 1842013005)

5I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.”


## Luke 13:6 (id: 1842013006)

6He spoke this parable. “A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.


## Luke 13:7 (id: 1842013007)

7He said to the vine dresser, ‘Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down! Why does it waste the soil?’


## Luke 13:8 (id: 1842013008)

8He answered, ‘Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.


## Luke 13:9 (id: 1842013009)

9If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.’”


## Luke 13:10 (id: 1842013010)

10He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.


## Luke 13:11 (id: 1842013011)

11Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years. She was bent over and could in no way straighten herself up.


## Luke 13:12 (id: 1842013012)

12When Jesus saw her, he called her and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.”


## Luke 13:13 (id: 1842013013)

13He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight and glorified God.


## Luke 13:14 (id: 1842013014)

14The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, “There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!”


## Luke 13:15 (id: 1842013015)

15Therefore the Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath and lead him away to water?


## Luke 13:16 (id: 1842013016)

16Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?”


## Luke 13:17 (id: 1842013017)

17As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.


## Luke 13:18 (id: 1842013018)

18He said, “What is God’s Kingdom like? To what shall I compare it?


## Luke 13:19 (id: 1842013019)

19It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his own garden. It grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky live in its branches.”


## Luke 13:20 (id: 1842013020)

20Again he said, “To what shall I compare God’s Kingdom?


## Luke 13:21 (id: 1842013021)

21It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.”


## Luke 13:22 (id: 1842013022)

22He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.


## Luke 13:23 (id: 1842013023)

23One said to him, “Lord, are they few who are saved?” He said to them,


## Luke 13:24 (id: 1842013024)

24“Striveto enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in and will not be able.


## Luke 13:25 (id: 1842013025)

25When once the master of the house has risen up and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ then he will answer and tell you, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’


## Luke 13:26 (id: 1842013026)

26Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’


## Luke 13:27 (id: 1842013027)

27He will say, ‘I tell you, I don’t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.’


## Luke 13:28 (id: 1842013028)

28There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in God’s Kingdom, and yourselves being thrown outside.


## Luke 13:29 (id: 1842013029)

29They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in God’s Kingdom.


## Luke 13:30 (id: 1842013030)

30Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last.”


## Luke 13:31 (id: 1842013031)

31On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, “Get out of here and go away, for Herod wants to kill you.”


## Luke 13:32 (id: 1842013032)

32He said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.


## Luke 13:33 (id: 1842013033)

33Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can’t be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.’


## Luke 13:34 (id: 1842013034)

34“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!


## Luke 13:35 (id: 1842013035)

35Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’”


## Luke 14:1 (id: 1842014001)

1When he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching him.


## Luke 14:2 (id: 1842014002)

2Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.


## Luke 14:3 (id: 1842014003)

3Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”


## Luke 14:4 (id: 1842014004)

4But they were silent. He took him, and healed him, and let him go.


## Luke 14:5 (id: 1842014005)

5He answered them, “Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, wouldn’t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?”


## Luke 14:6 (id: 1842014006)

6They couldn’t answer him regarding these things.


## Luke 14:7 (id: 1842014007)

7He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,


## Luke 14:8 (id: 1842014008)

8“When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, don’t sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,


## Luke 14:9 (id: 1842014009)

9and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, ‘Make room for this person.’ Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.


## Luke 14:10 (id: 1842014010)

10But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.


## Luke 14:11 (id: 1842014011)

11For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”


## Luke 14:12 (id: 1842014012)

12He also said to the one who had invited him, “When you make a dinner or a supper, don’t call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back.


## Luke 14:13 (id: 1842014013)

13Butwhen you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;


## Luke 14:14 (id: 1842014014)

14and you will be blessed, because they don’t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.”


## Luke 14:15 (id: 1842014015)

15When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed is he who will feast in God’s Kingdom!”


## Luke 14:16 (id: 1842014016)

16But he said to him, “A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.


## Luke 14:17 (id: 1842014017)

17He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready now.’


## Luke 14:18 (id: 1842014018)

18They all as one began to make excuses. “The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’


## Luke 14:19 (id: 1842014019)

19“Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.’


## Luke 14:20 (id: 1842014020)

20“Another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’


## Luke 14:21 (id: 1842014021)

21“That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’


## Luke 14:22 (id: 1842014022)

22“The servant said, ‘Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’


## Luke 14:23 (id: 1842014023)

23“The lord said to the servant, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.


## Luke 14:24 (id: 1842014024)

24For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper. For many are called, but few are chosen.’”


## Luke 14:25 (id: 1842014025)

25Now great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said to them,


## Luke 14:26 (id: 1842014026)

26“If anyone comes to me, and doesn’t disregard his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can’t be my disciple.


## Luke 14:27 (id: 1842014027)

27Whoever doesn’t bear his own cross and come after me, can’t be my disciple.


## Luke 14:28 (id: 1842014028)

28For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn’t first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?


## Luke 14:29 (id: 1842014029)

29Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation and isn’t able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,


## Luke 14:30 (id: 1842014030)

30saying, ‘This man began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’


## Luke 14:31 (id: 1842014031)

31Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?


## Luke 14:32 (id: 1842014032)

32Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy and asks for conditions of peace.


## Luke 14:33 (id: 1842014033)

33So therefore, whoever of you who doesn’t renounce all that he has, he can’t be my disciple.


## Luke 14:34 (id: 1842014034)

34“Saltis good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?


## Luke 14:35 (id: 1842014035)

35It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”


## Luke 15:1 (id: 1842015001)

1Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him.


## Luke 15:2 (id: 1842015002)

2The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, “This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.”


## Luke 15:3 (id: 1842015003)

3He told them this parable:


## Luke 15:4 (id: 1842015004)

4“Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety\-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?


## Luke 15:5 (id: 1842015005)

5When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.


## Luke 15:6 (id: 1842015006)

6When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’


## Luke 15:7 (id: 1842015007)

7I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety\-nine righteous people who need no repentance.


## Luke 15:8 (id: 1842015008)

8“Or what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn’t light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?


## Luke 15:9 (id: 1842015009)

9When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost!’


## Luke 15:10 (id: 1842015010)

10Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.”


## Luke 15:11 (id: 1842015011)

11He said, “A certain man had two sons.


## Luke 15:12 (id: 1842015012)

12The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of your property.’ So he divided his livelihood between them.


## Luke 15:13 (id: 1842015013)

13Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.


## Luke 15:14 (id: 1842015014)

14When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.


## Luke 15:15 (id: 1842015015)

15He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.


## Luke 15:16 (id: 1842015016)

16He wanted to fill his belly with the pods that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.


## Luke 15:17 (id: 1842015017)

17But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough to spare, and I’m dying with hunger!


## Luke 15:18 (id: 1842015018)

18I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.


## Luke 15:19 (id: 1842015019)

19I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”’


## Luke 15:20 (id: 1842015020)

20“He arose and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and ran, fell on his neck, and kissed him.


## Luke 15:21 (id: 1842015021)

21The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’


## Luke 15:22 (id: 1842015022)

22“But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.


## Luke 15:23 (id: 1842015023)

23Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let’s eat and celebrate;


## Luke 15:24 (id: 1842015024)

24for this, my son, was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found.’ Then they began to celebrate.


## Luke 15:25 (id: 1842015025)

25“Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.


## Luke 15:26 (id: 1842015026)

26He called one of the servants to him and asked what was going on.


## Luke 15:27 (id: 1842015027)

27He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.’


## Luke 15:28 (id: 1842015028)

28But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and begged him.


## Luke 15:29 (id: 1842015029)

29But he answered his father, ‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.


## Luke 15:30 (id: 1842015030)

30But when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’


## Luke 15:31 (id: 1842015031)

31“He said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.


## Luke 15:32 (id: 1842015032)

32But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’”


## Luke 16:1 (id: 1842016001)

1He also said to his disciples, “There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.


## Luke 16:2 (id: 1842016002)

2He called him, and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’


## Luke 16:3 (id: 1842016003)

3“The manager said within himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don’t have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.


## Luke 16:4 (id: 1842016004)

4I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.’


## Luke 16:5 (id: 1842016005)

5Calling each one of his lord’s debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe to my lord?’


## Luke 16:6 (id: 1842016006)

6He said, ‘A hundred batos of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’


## Luke 16:7 (id: 1842016007)

7Then he said to another, ‘How much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred cors of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’


## Luke 16:8 (id: 1842016008)

8“His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.


## Luke 16:9 (id: 1842016009)

9I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.


## Luke 16:10 (id: 1842016010)

10He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.


## Luke 16:11 (id: 1842016011)

11If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?


## Luke 16:12 (id: 1842016012)

12If you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?


## Luke 16:13 (id: 1842016013)

13No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to one and despise the other. You aren’t able to serve God and Mammon.”


## Luke 16:14 (id: 1842016014)

14The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.


## Luke 16:15 (id: 1842016015)

15He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.


## Luke 16:16 (id: 1842016016)

16“The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of God’s Kingdom is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.


## Luke 16:17 (id: 1842016017)

17But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.


## Luke 16:18 (id: 1842016018)

18“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.


## Luke 16:19 (id: 1842016019)

19“Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.


## Luke 16:20 (id: 1842016020)

20A certain beggar, named Lazarus, was taken to his gate, full of sores,


## Luke 16:21 (id: 1842016021)

21and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.


## Luke 16:22 (id: 1842016022)

22The beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.


## Luke 16:23 (id: 1842016023)

23In Hades, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom.


## Luke 16:24 (id: 1842016024)

24He cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.’


## Luke 16:25 (id: 1842016025)

25“But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But here he is now comforted and you are in anguish.


## Luke 16:26 (id: 1842016026)

26Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that no one may cross over from there to us.’


## Luke 16:27 (id: 1842016027)

27“He said, ‘I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house—


## Luke 16:28 (id: 1842016028)

28for I have five brothers—that he may testify to them, so they won’t also come into this place of torment.’


## Luke 16:29 (id: 1842016029)

29“But Abraham said to him, ‘They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.’


## Luke 16:30 (id: 1842016030)

30“He said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’


## Luke 16:31 (id: 1842016031)

31“He said to him, ‘If they don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.’”


## Luke 17:1 (id: 1842017001)

1He said to the disciples, “It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!


## Luke 17:2 (id: 1842017002)

2It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.


## Luke 17:3 (id: 1842017003)

3Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.


## Luke 17:4 (id: 1842017004)

4If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”


## Luke 17:5 (id: 1842017005)

5The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”


## Luke 17:6 (id: 1842017006)

6The Lord said, “If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.


## Luke 17:7 (id: 1842017007)

7But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table’?


## Luke 17:8 (id: 1842017008)

8Wouldn’the rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’?


## Luke 17:9 (id: 1842017009)

9Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.


## Luke 17:10 (id: 1842017010)

10Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’”


## Luke 17:11 (id: 1842017011)

11As he was on his way to Jerusalem, he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.


## Luke 17:12 (id: 1842017012)

12As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance.


## Luke 17:13 (id: 1842017013)

13They lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”


## Luke 17:14 (id: 1842017014)

14When he saw them, he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” As they went, they were cleansed.


## Luke 17:15 (id: 1842017015)

15One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.


## Luke 17:16 (id: 1842017016)

16He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.


## Luke 17:17 (id: 1842017017)

17Jesus answered, “Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?


## Luke 17:18 (id: 1842017018)

18Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?”


## Luke 17:19 (id: 1842017019)

19Then he said to him, “Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.”


## Luke 17:20 (id: 1842017020)

20Being asked by the Pharisees when God’s Kingdom would come, he answered them, “God’s Kingdom doesn’t come with observation;


## Luke 17:21 (id: 1842017021)

21neither will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, God’s Kingdom is within you.”


## Luke 17:22 (id: 1842017022)

22He said to the disciples, “The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.


## Luke 17:23 (id: 1842017023)

23They will tell you, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away or follow after them,


## Luke 17:24 (id: 1842017024)

24for as the lightning, when it flashes out of one part under the sky, shines to another part under the sky, so will the Son of Man be in his day.


## Luke 17:25 (id: 1842017025)

25But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.


## Luke 17:26 (id: 1842017026)

26As it was in the days of Noah, even so it will also be in the days of the Son of Man.


## Luke 17:27 (id: 1842017027)

27They ate, they drank, they married, and they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came and destroyed them all.


## Luke 17:28 (id: 1842017028)

28Likewise, even as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;


## Luke 17:29 (id: 1842017029)

29but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky and destroyed them all.


## Luke 17:30 (id: 1842017030)

30It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.


## Luke 17:31 (id: 1842017031)

31In that day, he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.


## Luke 17:32 (id: 1842017032)

32Remember Lot’s wife!


## Luke 17:33 (id: 1842017033)

33Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.


## Luke 17:34 (id: 1842017034)

34I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. One will be taken and the other will be left.


## Luke 17:35 (id: 1842017035)

35There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken and the other will be left.”


## Luke 17:37 (id: 1842017037)

37They, answering, asked him, “Where, Lord?” He said to them, “Where the body is, there the vultures will also be gathered together.”


## Luke 18:1 (id: 1842018001)

1He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray and not give up,


## Luke 18:2 (id: 1842018002)

2saying, “There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God and didn’t respect man.


## Luke 18:3 (id: 1842018003)

3A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’


## Luke 18:4 (id: 1842018004)

4He wouldn’t for a while; but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man,


## Luke 18:5 (id: 1842018005)

5yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’”


## Luke 18:6 (id: 1842018006)

6The Lord said, “Listento what the unrighteous judge says.


## Luke 18:7 (id: 1842018007)

7Won’t God avenge his chosen ones who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?


## Luke 18:8 (id: 1842018008)

8I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”


## Luke 18:9 (id: 1842018009)

9He also spoke this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others:


## Luke 18:10 (id: 1842018010)

10“Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.


## Luke 18:11 (id: 1842018011)

11The Pharisee stood and prayed by himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men: extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.


## Luke 18:12 (id: 1842018012)

12I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’


## Luke 18:13 (id: 1842018013)

13But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’


## Luke 18:14 (id: 1842018014)

14I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”


## Luke 18:15 (id: 1842018015)

15They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.


## Luke 18:16 (id: 1842018016)

16Jesus summoned them, saying, “Allowthe little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these.


## Luke 18:17 (id: 1842018017)

17Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”


## Luke 18:18 (id: 1842018018)

18A certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”


## Luke 18:19 (id: 1842018019)

19Jesus asked him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one: God.


## Luke 18:20 (id: 1842018020)

20You know the commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’”


## Luke 18:21 (id: 1842018021)

21He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.”


## Luke 18:22 (id: 1842018022)

22When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”


## Luke 18:23 (id: 1842018023)

23But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.


## Luke 18:24 (id: 1842018024)

24Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, “How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!


## Luke 18:25 (id: 1842018025)

25For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”


## Luke 18:26 (id: 1842018026)

26Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”


## Luke 18:27 (id: 1842018027)

27But he said, “The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”


## Luke 18:28 (id: 1842018028)

28Peter said, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”


## Luke 18:29 (id: 1842018029)

29He said to them, “Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for God’s Kingdom’s sake,


## Luke 18:30 (id: 1842018030)

30who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.”


## Luke 18:31 (id: 1842018031)

31He took the twelve aside and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.


## Luke 18:32 (id: 1842018032)

32For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.


## Luke 18:33 (id: 1842018033)

33They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.”


## Luke 18:34 (id: 1842018034)

34They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said.


## Luke 18:35 (id: 1842018035)

35As he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.


## Luke 18:36 (id: 1842018036)

36Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.


## Luke 18:37 (id: 1842018037)

37They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.


## Luke 18:38 (id: 1842018038)

38He cried out, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”


## Luke 18:39 (id: 1842018039)

39Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!”


## Luke 18:40 (id: 1842018040)

40Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,


## Luke 18:41 (id: 1842018041)

41“What do you want me to do?” He said, “Lord, that I may see again.”


## Luke 18:42 (id: 1842018042)

42Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.”


## Luke 18:43 (id: 1842018043)

43Immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.


## Luke 19:1 (id: 1842019001)

1He entered and was passing through Jericho.


## Luke 19:2 (id: 1842019002)

2There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.


## Luke 19:3 (id: 1842019003)

3He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn’t because of the crowd, because he was short.


## Luke 19:4 (id: 1842019004)

4He ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was going to pass that way.


## Luke 19:5 (id: 1842019005)

5When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”


## Luke 19:6 (id: 1842019006)

6He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully.


## Luke 19:7 (id: 1842019007)

7When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.”


## Luke 19:8 (id: 1842019008)

8Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much.”


## Luke 19:9 (id: 1842019009)

9Jesus said to him, “Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.


## Luke 19:10 (id: 1842019010)

10For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.”


## Luke 19:11 (id: 1842019011)

11As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that God’s Kingdom would be revealed immediately.


## Luke 19:12 (id: 1842019012)

12He said therefore, “A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.


## Luke 19:13 (id: 1842019013)

13He called ten servants of his and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, ‘Conduct business until I come.’


## Luke 19:14 (id: 1842019014)

14But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over us.’


## Luke 19:15 (id: 1842019015)

15“When he had come back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.


## Luke 19:16 (id: 1842019016)

16The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’


## Luke 19:17 (id: 1842019017)

17“He said to him, ‘Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’


## Luke 19:18 (id: 1842019018)

18“The second came, saying, ‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’


## Luke 19:19 (id: 1842019019)

19“So he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’


## Luke 19:20 (id: 1842019020)

20Another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,


## Luke 19:21 (id: 1842019021)

21for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap that which you didn’t sow.’


## Luke 19:22 (id: 1842019022)

22“He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down and reaping that which I didn’t sow.


## Luke 19:23 (id: 1842019023)

23Then why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’


## Luke 19:24 (id: 1842019024)

24He said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas.’


## Luke 19:25 (id: 1842019025)

25“They said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’


## Luke 19:26 (id: 1842019026)

26‘For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.


## Luke 19:27 (id: 1842019027)

27But bring those enemies of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.’”


## Luke 19:28 (id: 1842019028)

28Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.


## Luke 19:29 (id: 1842019029)

29When he came near to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,


## Luke 19:30 (id: 1842019030)

30saying, “Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, which no man has ever sat upon. Untie it and bring it.


## Luke 19:31 (id: 1842019031)

31If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say to him: ‘The Lord needs it.’”


## Luke 19:32 (id: 1842019032)

32Those who were sent went away and found things just as he had told them.


## Luke 19:33 (id: 1842019033)

33As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”


## Luke 19:34 (id: 1842019034)

34They said, “The Lord needs it.”


## Luke 19:35 (id: 1842019035)

35Then they brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt and sat Jesus on them.


## Luke 19:36 (id: 1842019036)

36As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road.


## Luke 19:37 (id: 1842019037)

37As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,


## Luke 19:38 (id: 1842019038)

38saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!”


## Luke 19:39 (id: 1842019039)

39Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”


## Luke 19:40 (id: 1842019040)

40He answered them, “I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.”


## Luke 19:41 (id: 1842019041)

41When he came near, he saw the city and wept over it,


## Luke 19:42 (id: 1842019042)

42saying, “If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes.


## Luke 19:43 (id: 1842019043)

43For the days will come on you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,


## Luke 19:44 (id: 1842019044)

44and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didn’t know the time of your visitation.”


## Luke 19:45 (id: 1842019045)

45He entered into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,


## Luke 19:46 (id: 1842019046)

46saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house is a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of robbers’!”


## Luke 19:47 (id: 1842019047)

47He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests, the scribes, and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him.


## Luke 19:48 (id: 1842019048)

48They couldn’t find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.


## Luke 20:1 (id: 1842020001)

1On one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, the priests and scribes came to him with the elders.


## Luke 20:2 (id: 1842020002)

2They asked him, “Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?”


## Luke 20:3 (id: 1842020003)

3He answered them, “I also will ask you one question. Tell me:


## Luke 20:4 (id: 1842020004)

4the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?”


## Luke 20:5 (id: 1842020005)

5They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’


## Luke 20:6 (id: 1842020006)

6But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”


## Luke 20:7 (id: 1842020007)

7They answered that they didn’t know where it was from.


## Luke 20:8 (id: 1842020008)

8Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”


## Luke 20:9 (id: 1842020009)

9He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.


## Luke 20:10 (id: 1842020010)

10At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty.


## Luke 20:11 (id: 1842020011)

11He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.


## Luke 20:12 (id: 1842020012)

12He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him and threw him out.


## Luke 20:13 (id: 1842020013)

13The lord of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.’


## Luke 20:14 (id: 1842020014)

14“But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’


## Luke 20:15 (id: 1842020015)

15Then they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?


## Luke 20:16 (id: 1842020016)

16He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.” When they heard that, they said, “May that never be!”


## Luke 20:17 (id: 1842020017)

17But he looked at them and said, “Then what is this that is written, ‘The stone which the builders rejected was made the chief cornerstone’?


## Luke 20:18 (id: 1842020018)

18Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.”


## Luke 20:19 (id: 1842020019)

19The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people—for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.


## Luke 20:20 (id: 1842020020)

20They watched him and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.


## Luke 20:21 (id: 1842020021)

21They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.


## Luke 20:22 (id: 1842020022)

22Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”


## Luke 20:23 (id: 1842020023)

23But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, “Whydo you test me?


## Luke 20:24 (id: 1842020024)

24Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” They answered, “Caesar’s.”


## Luke 20:25 (id: 1842020025)

25He said to them, “Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”


## Luke 20:26 (id: 1842020026)

26They weren’t able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer and were silent.


## Luke 20:27 (id: 1842020027)

27Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.


## Luke 20:28 (id: 1842020028)

28They asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up children for his brother.


## Luke 20:29 (id: 1842020029)

29There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.


## Luke 20:30 (id: 1842020030)

30The second took her as wife, and he died childless.


## Luke 20:31 (id: 1842020031)

31The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.


## Luke 20:32 (id: 1842020032)

32Afterward the woman also died.


## Luke 20:33 (id: 1842020033)

33Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.”


## Luke 20:34 (id: 1842020034)

34Jesus said to them, “The children of this age marry and are given in marriage.


## Luke 20:35 (id: 1842020035)

35But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.


## Luke 20:36 (id: 1842020036)

36For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.


## Luke 20:37 (id: 1842020037)

37But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord ‘The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’


## Luke 20:38 (id: 1842020038)

38Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.”


## Luke 20:39 (id: 1842020039)

39Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you speak well.”


## Luke 20:40 (id: 1842020040)

40They didn’t dare to ask him any more questions.


## Luke 20:41 (id: 1842020041)

41He said to them, “Why do they say that the Christ is David’s son?


## Luke 20:42 (id: 1842020042)

42David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,


## Luke 20:43 (id: 1842020043)

43until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.”’


## Luke 20:44 (id: 1842020044)

44“David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?”


## Luke 20:45 (id: 1842020045)

45In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,


## Luke 20:46 (id: 1842020046)

46“Beware of those scribes who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;


## Luke 20:47 (id: 1842020047)

47who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”


## Luke 21:1 (id: 1842021001)

1He looked up and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury.


## Luke 21:2 (id: 1842021002)

2He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins.


## Luke 21:3 (id: 1842021003)

3He said, “TrulyI tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,


## Luke 21:4 (id: 1842021004)

4for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on.”


## Luke 21:5 (id: 1842021005)

5As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,


## Luke 21:6 (id: 1842021006)

6“As for these things which you see, the days will come in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down.”


## Luke 21:7 (id: 1842021007)

7They asked him, “Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?”


## Luke 21:8 (id: 1842021008)

8He said, “Watchout that you don’t get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’and, ‘The time is at hand.’ Therefore don’t follow them.


## Luke 21:9 (id: 1842021009)

9When you hear of wars and disturbances, don’t be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won’t come immediately.”


## Luke 21:10 (id: 1842021010)

10Then he said to them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.


## Luke 21:11 (id: 1842021011)

11There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.


## Luke 21:12 (id: 1842021012)

12But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name’s sake.


## Luke 21:13 (id: 1842021013)

13It will turn out as a testimony for you.


## Luke 21:14 (id: 1842021014)

14Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,


## Luke 21:15 (id: 1842021015)

15for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.


## Luke 21:16 (id: 1842021016)

16You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death.


## Luke 21:17 (id: 1842021017)

17You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake.


## Luke 21:18 (id: 1842021018)

18And not a hair of your head will perish.


## Luke 21:19 (id: 1842021019)

19“By your endurance you will win your lives.


## Luke 21:20 (id: 1842021020)

20“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.


## Luke 21:21 (id: 1842021021)

21Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the middle of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein.


## Luke 21:22 (id: 1842021022)

22For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.


## Luke 21:23 (id: 1842021023)

23Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath to this people.


## Luke 21:24 (id: 1842021024)

24They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.


## Luke 21:25 (id: 1842021025)

25“There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;


## Luke 21:26 (id: 1842021026)

26men fainting for fear and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.


## Luke 21:27 (id: 1842021027)

27Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.


## Luke 21:28 (id: 1842021028)

28But when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.”


## Luke 21:29 (id: 1842021029)

29He told them a parable. “See the fig tree and all the trees.


## Luke 21:30 (id: 1842021030)

30When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.


## Luke 21:31 (id: 1842021031)

31Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that God’s Kingdom is near.


## Luke 21:32 (id: 1842021032)

32Mostcertainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.


## Luke 21:33 (id: 1842021033)

33Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.


## Luke 21:34 (id: 1842021034)

34“So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.


## Luke 21:35 (id: 1842021035)

35For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.


## Luke 21:36 (id: 1842021036)

36Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”


## Luke 21:37 (id: 1842021037)

37Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.


## Luke 21:38 (id: 1842021038)

38All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.


## Luke 22:1 (id: 1842022001)

1Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.


## Luke 22:2 (id: 1842022002)

2The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.


## Luke 22:3 (id: 1842022003)

3Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve.


## Luke 22:4 (id: 1842022004)

4He went away and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.


## Luke 22:5 (id: 1842022005)

5They were glad, and agreed to give him money.


## Luke 22:6 (id: 1842022006)

6He consented and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.


## Luke 22:7 (id: 1842022007)

7The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.


## Luke 22:8 (id: 1842022008)

8Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”


## Luke 22:9 (id: 1842022009)

9They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”


## Luke 22:10 (id: 1842022010)

10He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.


## Luke 22:11 (id: 1842022011)

11Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’


## Luke 22:12 (id: 1842022012)

12He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”


## Luke 22:13 (id: 1842022013)

13They went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.


## Luke 22:14 (id: 1842022014)

14When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.


## Luke 22:15 (id: 1842022015)

15He said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,


## Luke 22:16 (id: 1842022016)

16for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”


## Luke 22:17 (id: 1842022017)

17He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, “Take this and share it among yourselves,


## Luke 22:18 (id: 1842022018)

18for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”


## Luke 22:19 (id: 1842022019)

19He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”


## Luke 22:20 (id: 1842022020)

20Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.


## Luke 22:21 (id: 1842022021)

21But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.


## Luke 22:22 (id: 1842022022)

22The Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”


## Luke 22:23 (id: 1842022023)

23They began to question among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing.


## Luke 22:24 (id: 1842022024)

24A dispute also arose among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.


## Luke 22:25 (id: 1842022025)

25He said to them, “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’


## Luke 22:26 (id: 1842022026)

26But not so with you. Rather, the one who is greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.


## Luke 22:27 (id: 1842022027)

27For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.


## Luke 22:28 (id: 1842022028)

28“But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.


## Luke 22:29 (id: 1842022029)

29I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,


## Luke 22:30 (id: 1842022030)

30that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”


## Luke 22:31 (id: 1842022031)

31The Lord said, “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat,


## Luke 22:32 (id: 1842022032)

32but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”


## Luke 22:33 (id: 1842022033)

33He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”


## Luke 22:34 (id: 1842022034)

34He said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”


## Luke 22:35 (id: 1842022035)

35He said to them, “When I sent you out without purse, bag, and sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.”


## Luke 22:36 (id: 1842022036)

36Then he said to them, “But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a bag. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.


## Luke 22:37 (id: 1842022037)

37For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’ For that which concerns me is being fulfilled.”


## Luke 22:38 (id: 1842022038)

38They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” He said to them, “That is enough.”


## Luke 22:39 (id: 1842022039)

39He came out and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.


## Luke 22:40 (id: 1842022040)

40When he was at the place, he said to them, “Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”


## Luke 22:41 (id: 1842022041)

41He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,


## Luke 22:42 (id: 1842022042)

42saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”


## Luke 22:43 (id: 1842022043)

43An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.


## Luke 22:44 (id: 1842022044)

44Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.


## Luke 22:45 (id: 1842022045)

45When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief,


## Luke 22:46 (id: 1842022046)

46and said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”


## Luke 22:47 (id: 1842022047)

47While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared. He who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.


## Luke 22:48 (id: 1842022048)

48But Jesus said to him, “Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”


## Luke 22:49 (id: 1842022049)

49When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”


## Luke 22:50 (id: 1842022050)

50A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.


## Luke 22:51 (id: 1842022051)

51But Jesus answered, “Let me at least do this”—and he touched his ear and healed him.


## Luke 22:52 (id: 1842022052)

52Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?


## Luke 22:53 (id: 1842022053)

53When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”


## Luke 22:54 (id: 1842022054)

54They seized him and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance.


## Luke 22:55 (id: 1842022055)

55When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.


## Luke 22:56 (id: 1842022056)

56A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.”


## Luke 22:57 (id: 1842022057)

57He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”


## Luke 22:58 (id: 1842022058)

58After a little while someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”


## Luke 22:59 (id: 1842022059)

59After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!”


## Luke 22:60 (id: 1842022060)

60But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.


## Luke 22:61 (id: 1842022061)

61The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, “Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”


## Luke 22:62 (id: 1842022062)

62He went out, and wept bitterly.


## Luke 22:63 (id: 1842022063)

63The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.


## Luke 22:64 (id: 1842022064)

64Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”


## Luke 22:65 (id: 1842022065)

65They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.


## Luke 22:66 (id: 1842022066)

66As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,


## Luke 22:67 (id: 1842022067)

67“If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you won’t believe,


## Luke 22:68 (id: 1842022068)

68and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.


## Luke 22:69 (id: 1842022069)

69From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”


## Luke 22:70 (id: 1842022070)

70They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say it, because I am.”


## Luke 22:71 (id: 1842022071)

71They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”


## Luke 23:1 (id: 1842023001)

1The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.


## Luke 23:2 (id: 1842023002)

2They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”


## Luke 23:3 (id: 1842023003)

3Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered him, “So you say.”


## Luke 23:4 (id: 1842023004)

4Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”


## Luke 23:5 (id: 1842023005)

5But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”


## Luke 23:6 (id: 1842023006)

6But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.


## Luke 23:7 (id: 1842023007)

7When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.


## Luke 23:8 (id: 1842023008)

8Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.


## Luke 23:9 (id: 1842023009)

9He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.


## Luke 23:10 (id: 1842023010)

10The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.


## Luke 23:11 (id: 1842023011)

11Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.


## Luke 23:12 (id: 1842023012)

12Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.


## Luke 23:13 (id: 1842023013)

13Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,


## Luke 23:14 (id: 1842023014)

14and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.


## Luke 23:15 (id: 1842023015)

15Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.


## Luke 23:16 (id: 1842023016)

16I will therefore chastise him and release him.”


## Luke 23:17 (id: 1842023017)

17Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.


## Luke 23:18 (id: 1842023018)

18But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—


## Luke 23:19 (id: 1842023019)

19one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.


## Luke 23:20 (id: 1842023020)

20Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,


## Luke 23:21 (id: 1842023021)

21but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”


## Luke 23:22 (id: 1842023022)

22He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”


## Luke 23:23 (id: 1842023023)

23But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.


## Luke 23:24 (id: 1842023024)

24Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.


## Luke 23:25 (id: 1842023025)

25He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.


## Luke 23:26 (id: 1842023026)

26When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it after Jesus.


## Luke 23:27 (id: 1842023027)

27A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.


## Luke 23:28 (id: 1842023028)

28But Jesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.


## Luke 23:29 (id: 1842023029)

29For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’


## Luke 23:30 (id: 1842023030)

30Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’


## Luke 23:31 (id: 1842023031)

31For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”


## Luke 23:32 (id: 1842023032)

32There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.


## Luke 23:33 (id: 1842023033)

33When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.


## Luke 23:34 (id: 1842023034)

34Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.


## Luke 23:35 (id: 1842023035)

35The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”


## Luke 23:36 (id: 1842023036)

36The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,


## Luke 23:37 (id: 1842023037)

37and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”


## Luke 23:38 (id: 1842023038)

38An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”


## Luke 23:39 (id: 1842023039)

39One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”


## Luke 23:40 (id: 1842023040)

40But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?


## Luke 23:41 (id: 1842023041)

41And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”


## Luke 23:42 (id: 1842023042)

42He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”


## Luke 23:43 (id: 1842023043)

43Jesus said to him, “AssuredlyI tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”


## Luke 23:44 (id: 1842023044)

44It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.


## Luke 23:45 (id: 1842023045)

45The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.


## Luke 23:46 (id: 1842023046)

46Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last.


## Luke 23:47 (id: 1842023047)

47When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.”


## Luke 23:48 (id: 1842023048)

48All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their chests.


## Luke 23:49 (id: 1842023049)

49All his acquaintances and the women who followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things.


## Luke 23:50 (id: 1842023050)

50Behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man


## Luke 23:51 (id: 1842023051)

51(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom.


## Luke 23:52 (id: 1842023052)

52This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.


## Luke 23:53 (id: 1842023053)

53He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.


## Luke 23:54 (id: 1842023054)

54It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.


## Luke 23:55 (id: 1842023055)

55The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.


## Luke 23:56 (id: 1842023056)

56They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.


## Luke 24:1 (id: 1842024001)

1But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.


## Luke 24:2 (id: 1842024002)

2They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.


## Luke 24:3 (id: 1842024003)

3They entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body.


## Luke 24:4 (id: 1842024004)

4While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.


## Luke 24:5 (id: 1842024005)

5Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. The men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?


## Luke 24:6 (id: 1842024006)

6He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,


## Luke 24:7 (id: 1842024007)

7saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again?”


## Luke 24:8 (id: 1842024008)

8They remembered his words,


## Luke 24:9 (id: 1842024009)

9returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.


## Luke 24:10 (id: 1842024010)

10Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.


## Luke 24:11 (id: 1842024011)

11These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them.


## Luke 24:12 (id: 1842024012)

12But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.


## Luke 24:13 (id: 1842024013)

13Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.


## Luke 24:14 (id: 1842024014)

14They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.


## Luke 24:15 (id: 1842024015)

15While they talked and questioned together, Jesus himself came near, and went with them.


## Luke 24:16 (id: 1842024016)

16But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.


## Luke 24:17 (id: 1842024017)

17He said to them, “What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?”


## Luke 24:18 (id: 1842024018)

18One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things which have happened there in these days?”


## Luke 24:19 (id: 1842024019)

19He said to them, “What things?” They said to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;


## Luke 24:20 (id: 1842024020)

20and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.


## Luke 24:21 (id: 1842024021)

21But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.


## Luke 24:22 (id: 1842024022)

22Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;


## Luke 24:23 (id: 1842024023)

23and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.


## Luke 24:24 (id: 1842024024)

24Some of us went to the tomb and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”


## Luke 24:25 (id: 1842024025)

25He said to them, “Foolish people, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!


## Luke 24:26 (id: 1842024026)

26Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”


## Luke 24:27 (id: 1842024027)

27Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.


## Luke 24:28 (id: 1842024028)

28They came near to the village where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.


## Luke 24:29 (id: 1842024029)

29They urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.” He went in to stay with them.


## Luke 24:30 (id: 1842024030)

30When he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave it to them.


## Luke 24:31 (id: 1842024031)

31Their eyes were opened and they recognized him; then he vanished out of their sight.


## Luke 24:32 (id: 1842024032)

32They said to one another, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?”


## Luke 24:33 (id: 1842024033)

33They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,


## Luke 24:34 (id: 1842024034)

34saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!”


## Luke 24:35 (id: 1842024035)

35They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.


## Luke 24:36 (id: 1842024036)

36As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peacebe to you.”


## Luke 24:37 (id: 1842024037)

37But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.


## Luke 24:38 (id: 1842024038)

38He said to them, “Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?


## Luke 24:39 (id: 1842024039)

39See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”


## Luke 24:40 (id: 1842024040)

40When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.


## Luke 24:41 (id: 1842024041)

41While they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”


## Luke 24:42 (id: 1842024042)

42They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.


## Luke 24:43 (id: 1842024043)

43He took them, and ate in front of them.


## Luke 24:44 (id: 1842024044)

44He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms concerning me must be fulfilled.”


## Luke 24:45 (id: 1842024045)

45Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.


## Luke 24:46 (id: 1842024046)

46He said to them, “Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,


## Luke 24:47 (id: 1842024047)

47and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.


## Luke 24:48 (id: 1842024048)

48You are witnesses of these things.


## Luke 24:49 (id: 1842024049)

49Behold, I send out the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.”


## Luke 24:50 (id: 1842024050)

50He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.


## Luke 24:51 (id: 1842024051)

51While he blessed them, he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven.


## Luke 24:52 (id: 1842024052)

52They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,


## Luke 24:53 (id: 1842024053)

53and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
