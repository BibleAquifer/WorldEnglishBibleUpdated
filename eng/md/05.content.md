26Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God.


## Deuteronomy 1:27 (id: 1805001027)

## Deuteronomy 1:28 (id: 1805001028)

28Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’”


## Deuteronomy 1:29 (id: 1805001029)

## Deuteronomy 1:32 (id: 1805001032)

32Yet in this thing you didn’t believe the LORD your God,


## Deuteronomy 1:33 (id: 1805001033)

33who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.


## Deuteronomy 1:34 (id: 1805001034)

## Deuteronomy 1:36 (id: 1805001036)

## Deuteronomy 1:40 (id: 1805001040)

40But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”


## Deuteronomy 1:41 (id: 1805001041)

41Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.


## Deuteronomy 1:42 (id: 1805001042)

42The LORD said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’”


## Deuteronomy 1:43 (id: 1805001043)

43So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.


## Deuteronomy 1:44 (id: 1805001044)

44The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.


## Deuteronomy 1:45 (id: 1805001045)

45You returned and wept before the LORD, but the LORD didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn his ear to you.


## Deuteronomy 1:46 (id: 1805001046)

46So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.


## Deuteronomy 2:1 (id: 1805002001)

1Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the LORD spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.


## Deuteronomy 2:2 (id: 1805002002)

2The LORD spoke to me, saying,


## Deuteronomy 2:3 (id: 1805002003)

3“You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.


## Deuteronomy 2:4 (id: 1805002004)

4Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful.


## Deuteronomy 2:5 (id: 1805002005)

5Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.


## Deuteronomy 2:6 (id: 1805002006)

6You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’”


## Deuteronomy 2:7 (id: 1805002007)

7For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, the LORD your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.


## Deuteronomy 2:8 (id: 1805002008)

8So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.


## Deuteronomy 2:9 (id: 1805002009)

9The LORD said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.”


## Deuteronomy 2:10 (id: 1805002010)

10(The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as the Anakim.


## Deuteronomy 2:11 (id: 1805002011)

11These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.


## Deuteronomy 2:12 (id: 1805002012)

12The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.)


## Deuteronomy 2:13 (id: 1805002013)

13“Now rise up and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered.


## Deuteronomy 2:14 (id: 1805002014)

14The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty\-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as the LORD swore to them.


## Deuteronomy 2:15 (id: 1805002015)

15Moreover the LORD’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed.


## Deuteronomy 2:16 (id: 1805002016)

16So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,


## Deuteronomy 2:17 (id: 1805002017)

17the LORD spoke to me, saying,


## Deuteronomy 2:18 (id: 1805002018)

18“You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today.


## Deuteronomy 2:19 (id: 1805002019)

19When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.”


## Deuteronomy 2:20 (id: 1805002020)

20(That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,


## Deuteronomy 2:21 (id: 1805002021)

21a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place,


## Deuteronomy 2:22 (id: 1805002022)

22as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day.


## Deuteronomy 2:23 (id: 1805002023)

23Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.)


## Deuteronomy 2:24 (id: 1805002024)

24“Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.


## Deuteronomy 2:25 (id: 1805002025)

25Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.”


## Deuteronomy 2:26 (id: 1805002026)

26I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,


## Deuteronomy 2:27 (id: 1805002027)

27“Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.


## Deuteronomy 2:28 (id: 1805002028)

28You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet,


## Deuteronomy 2:29 (id: 1805002029)

29as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I pass over the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.”


## Deuteronomy 2:30 (id: 1805002030)

30But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is today.


## Deuteronomy 2:31 (id: 1805002031)

31The LORD said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.”


## Deuteronomy 2:32 (id: 1805002032)

32Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.


## Deuteronomy 2:33 (id: 1805002033)

33The LORD our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people.


## Deuteronomy 2:34 (id: 1805002034)

34We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining.


## Deuteronomy 2:35 (id: 1805002035)

35Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken.


## Deuteronomy 2:36 (id: 1805002036)

36From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. The LORD our God delivered up all before us.


## Deuteronomy 2:37 (id: 1805002037)

37Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God forbade us.


## Deuteronomy 3:1 (id: 1805003001)

1Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.


## Deuteronomy 3:2 (id: 1805003002)

2The LORD said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”


## Deuteronomy 3:3 (id: 1805003003)

3So the LORD our God also delivered into our hand Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining.


## Deuteronomy 3:4 (id: 1805003004)

4We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.


## Deuteronomy 3:5 (id: 1805003005)

5All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many villages without walls.


## Deuteronomy 3:6 (id: 1805003006)

6We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.


## Deuteronomy 3:7 (id: 1805003007)

7But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves.


## Deuteronomy 3:8 (id: 1805003008)

8We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon.


## Deuteronomy 3:9 (id: 1805003009)

9(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.)


## Deuteronomy 3:10 (id: 1805003010)

10We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.


## Deuteronomy 3:11 (id: 1805003011)

11(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its width, after the cubit of a man.)


## Deuteronomy 3:12 (id: 1805003012)

12This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites;


## Deuteronomy 3:13 (id: 1805003013)

13and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half\-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.


## Deuteronomy 3:14 (id: 1805003014)

14Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)


## Deuteronomy 3:15 (id: 1805003015)

15I gave Gilead to Machir.


## Deuteronomy 3:16 (id: 1805003016)

16To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;


## Deuteronomy 3:17 (id: 1805003017)

17the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.


## Deuteronomy 3:18 (id: 1805003018)

18I commanded you at that time, saying, “The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it. All of you men of valor shall pass over armed before your brothers, the children of Israel.


## Deuteronomy 3:19 (id: 1805003019)

19But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,


## Deuteronomy 3:20 (id: 1805003020)

20until the LORD gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to his own possession, which I have given you.”


## Deuteronomy 3:21 (id: 1805003021)

21I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms where you go over.


## Deuteronomy 3:22 (id: 1805003022)

22You shall not fear them; for the LORD your God himself fights for you.”


## Deuteronomy 3:23 (id: 1805003023)

23I begged GOD at that time, saying,


## Deuteronomy 3:24 (id: 1805003024)

24“Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours?


## Deuteronomy 3:25 (id: 1805003025)

25Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.”


## Deuteronomy 3:26 (id: 1805003026)

26But the LORD was angry with me because of you, and didn’t listen to me. The LORD said to me, “That is enough! Speak no more to me of this matter.


## Deuteronomy 3:27 (id: 1805003027)

27Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan.


## Deuteronomy 3:28 (id: 1805003028)

28But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.”


## Deuteronomy 3:29 (id: 1805003029)

29So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.


## Deuteronomy 4:1 (id: 1805004001)

1Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances which I teach you, to do them, that you may live and go in and possess the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, gives you.


## Deuteronomy 4:2 (id: 1805004002)

2You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.


## Deuteronomy 4:3 (id: 1805004003)

3Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal Peor; for the LORD your God has destroyed all the men who followed Baal Peor from among you.


## Deuteronomy 4:4 (id: 1805004004)

4But you who were faithful to the LORD your God are all alive today.


## Deuteronomy 4:5 (id: 1805004005)

5Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do so in the middle of the land where you go in to possess it.


## Deuteronomy 4:6 (id: 1805004006)

6Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who shall hear all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”


## Deuteronomy 4:7 (id: 1805004007)

7For what great nation is there that has a god so near to them as the LORD our God is whenever we call on him?


## Deuteronomy 4:8 (id: 1805004008)

8What great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law which I set before you today?


## Deuteronomy 4:9 (id: 1805004009)

9Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children—


## Deuteronomy 4:10 (id: 1805004010)

10the day that you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.”


## Deuteronomy 4:11 (id: 1805004011)

11You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.


## Deuteronomy 4:12 (id: 1805004012)

12The LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice.


## Deuteronomy 4:13 (id: 1805004013)

13He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets.


## Deuteronomy 4:14 (id: 1805004014)

14The LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.


## Deuteronomy 4:15 (id: 1805004015)

15Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire,


## Deuteronomy 4:16 (id: 1805004016)

16lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,


## Deuteronomy 4:17 (id: 1805004017)

17the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,


## Deuteronomy 4:18 (id: 1805004018)

22and the LORD showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;

3You shall not make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son.


## Deuteronomy 7:4 (id: 1805007004)

4For that would turn away your sons from following me, that they may serve other gods. So the LORD’s anger would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.

5But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved images with fire.

## Deuteronomy 7:7 (id: 1805007007)

7The LORD didn’t set his love on you nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples;


## Deuteronomy 7:8 (id: 1805007008)

8but because the LORD loves you, and because he desires to keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 7:9 (id: 1805007009)

9Know therefore that the LORD your God himself is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness to a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commandments,

10and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face.

## Deuteronomy 7:16 (id: 1805007016)

16You shall consume all the peoples whom the LORD your God shall deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them. You shall not serve their gods; for that would be a snare to you.


## Deuteronomy 7:17 (id: 1805007017)

17If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?”


## Deuteronomy 7:18 (id: 1805007018)

18you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:


## Deuteronomy 7:19 (id: 1805007019)

19the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the LORD your God brought you out. So shall the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.


## Deuteronomy 7:20 (id: 1805007020)

20Moreover the LORD your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.

21You shall not be scared of them; for the LORD your God is among you, a great and awesome God.


## Deuteronomy 7:22 (id: 1805007022)

22The LORD your God will cast out those nations before you little by little. You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.

23But the LORD your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed.

## Deuteronomy 7:25 (id: 1805007025)

25You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.


## Deuteronomy 7:26 (id: 1805007026)

26You shall not bring an abomination into your house and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it. You shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.


## Deuteronomy 8:1 (id: 1805008001)

1You shall observe to do all the commandments which I command you today, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers.


## Deuteronomy 8:2 (id: 1805008002)

2You shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not.


## Deuteronomy 8:3 (id: 1805008003)

## Deuteronomy 8:4 (id: 1805008004)

## Deuteronomy 8:8 (id: 1805008008)

8a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;


## Deuteronomy 8:9 (id: 1805008009)

9a land in which you shall eat bread without scarcity, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.

10You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which he has given you.

12lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built fine houses and lived in them;

13and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;


## Deuteronomy 8:14 (id: 1805008014)

14then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;


## Deuteronomy 8:15 (id: 1805008015)

15who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with venomous snakes and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water for you out of the rock of flint;


## Deuteronomy 8:16 (id: 1805008016)

16who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end;

17and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.”


## Deuteronomy 8:18 (id: 1805008018)

18But you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is today.


## Deuteronomy 8:19 (id: 1805008019)

19It shall be, if you shall forget the LORD your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you shall surely perish.


## Deuteronomy 8:20 (id: 1805008020)

20As the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so you shall perish, because you wouldn’t listen to the LORD your God’s voice.


## Deuteronomy 9:1 (id: 1805009001)

1Hear, Israel! You are to pass over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,


## Deuteronomy 9:2 (id: 1805009002)

2a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?”


## Deuteronomy 9:3 (id: 1805009003)

3Know therefore today that the LORD your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them and he will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as the LORD has spoken to you.


## Deuteronomy 9:4 (id: 1805009004)

4Don’t say in your heart, after the LORD your God has thrust them out from before you, “For my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land;” because the LORD drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.


## Deuteronomy 9:5 (id: 1805009005)

5Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.


## Deuteronomy 9:6 (id: 1805009006)

6Know therefore that the LORD your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness, for you are a stiff\-necked people.


## Deuteronomy 9:7 (id: 1805009007)

7Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.


## Deuteronomy 9:8 (id: 1805009008)

8Also in Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was angry with you to destroy you.


## Deuteronomy 9:9 (id: 1805009009)

9When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.


## Deuteronomy 9:10 (id: 1805009010)

10The LORD delivered to me the two stone tablets written with God’s finger. On them were all the words which the LORD spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.


## Deuteronomy 9:11 (id: 1805009011)

11It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant.


## Deuteronomy 9:12 (id: 1805009012)

12The LORD said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned away from the way which I commanded them. They have made a molten image for themselves!”


## Deuteronomy 9:13 (id: 1805009013)

13Furthermore the LORD spoke to me, saying, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff\-necked people.


## Deuteronomy 9:14 (id: 1805009014)

14Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”


## Deuteronomy 9:15 (id: 1805009015)

15So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.


## Deuteronomy 9:16 (id: 1805009016)

16I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God. You had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which the LORD had commanded you.


## Deuteronomy 9:17 (id: 1805009017)

17I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.


## Deuteronomy 9:18 (id: 1805009018)

18I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, to provoke him to anger.


## Deuteronomy 9:19 (id: 1805009019)

19For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was angry against you to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me that time also.


## Deuteronomy 9:20 (id: 1805009020)

20The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.


## Deuteronomy 9:21 (id: 1805009021)

21I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.


## Deuteronomy 9:22 (id: 1805009022)

22At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath.


## Deuteronomy 9:23 (id: 1805009023)

23When the LORD sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and you didn’t believe him or listen to his voice.


## Deuteronomy 9:24 (id: 1805009024)

24You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.


## Deuteronomy 9:25 (id: 1805009025)

25So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because the LORD had said he would destroy you.


## Deuteronomy 9:26 (id: 1805009026)

26I prayed to the LORD, and said, “Lord GOD, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.


## Deuteronomy 9:27 (id: 1805009027)

27Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin,


## Deuteronomy 9:28 (id: 1805009028)

28lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’


## Deuteronomy 9:29 (id: 1805009029)

29Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”


## Deuteronomy 10:1 (id: 1805010001)

1At that time the LORD said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.


## Deuteronomy 10:2 (id: 1805010002)

2I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.”


## Deuteronomy 10:3 (id: 1805010003)

3So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.


## Deuteronomy 10:4 (id: 1805010004)

4He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly; and the LORD gave them to me.


## Deuteronomy 10:5 (id: 1805010005)

5I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as the LORD commanded me.


## Deuteronomy 10:6 (id: 1805010006)

6(The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place.


## Deuteronomy 10:7 (id: 1805010007)

7From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.


## Deuteronomy 10:8 (id: 1805010008)

8At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the LORD’s covenant, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.


## Deuteronomy 10:9 (id: 1805010009)

9Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God spoke to him.)


## Deuteronomy 10:10 (id: 1805010010)

10I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD listened to me that time also. The LORD would not destroy you.


## Deuteronomy 10:11 (id: 1805010011)

11The LORD said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.”


## Deuteronomy 10:12 (id: 1805010012)

12Now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,


## Deuteronomy 10:13 (id: 1805010013)

13to keep the LORD’s commandments and statutes, which I command you today for your good?


## Deuteronomy 10:14 (id: 1805010014)

14Behold, to the LORD your God belongs heaven, the heaven of heavens, and the earth, with all that is therein.


## Deuteronomy 10:15 (id: 1805010015)

15Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their offspring after them, even you above all peoples, as it is today.


## Deuteronomy 10:16 (id: 1805010016)

16Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff\-necked.


## Deuteronomy 10:17 (id: 1805010017)

17For the LORD your God, he is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn’t respect persons or take bribes.


## Deuteronomy 10:18 (id: 1805010018)

18He executes justice for the fatherless and widow and loves the foreigner in giving him food and clothing.


## Deuteronomy 10:19 (id: 1805010019)

19Therefore love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 10:20 (id: 1805010020)

20You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him. You shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name.

22Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude.


## Deuteronomy 11:1 (id: 1805011001)

1Therefore you shall love the LORD your God, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances, and his commandments, always.


## Deuteronomy 11:2 (id: 1805011002)

2Know this day—for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm,


## Deuteronomy 11:3 (id: 1805011003)

3his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;


## Deuteronomy 11:4 (id: 1805011004)

4and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day;


## Deuteronomy 11:5 (id: 1805011005)

5and what he did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place;


## Deuteronomy 11:6 (id: 1805011006)

6and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben—how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel;


## Deuteronomy 11:7 (id: 1805011007)

7but your eyes have seen all of the LORD’s great work which he did.


## Deuteronomy 11:8 (id: 1805011008)

8Therefore you shall keep the entire commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land that you go over to possess;


## Deuteronomy 11:9 (id: 1805011009)

9and that you may prolong your days in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey.


## Deuteronomy 11:10 (id: 1805011010)

10For the land, where you go in to possess isn’t like the land of Egypt that you came out of, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;


## Deuteronomy 11:11 (id: 1805011011)

11but the land that you go over to possess is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky,


## Deuteronomy 11:12 (id: 1805011012)

12a land which the LORD your God cares for. The LORD your God’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.


## Deuteronomy 11:13 (id: 1805011013)

13It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you today, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,


## Deuteronomy 11:14 (id: 1805011014)

14that I will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.


## Deuteronomy 11:15 (id: 1805011015)

15I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.


## Deuteronomy 11:16 (id: 1805011016)

16Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away to serve other gods and worship them;


## Deuteronomy 11:17 (id: 1805011017)

17and the LORD’s anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky so that there is no rain, and the land doesn’t yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.


## Deuteronomy 11:18 (id: 1805011018)

18Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.


## Deuteronomy 11:19 (id: 1805011019)

19You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.


## Deuteronomy 11:20 (id: 1805011020)

20You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates;


## Deuteronomy 11:21 (id: 1805011021)

21that your days and your children’s days may be multiplied in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.


## Deuteronomy 11:22 (id: 1805011022)

22For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you—to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him—


## Deuteronomy 11:23 (id: 1805011023)

23then the LORD will drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.


## Deuteronomy 11:24 (id: 1805011024)

24Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be your border.


## Deuteronomy 11:25 (id: 1805011025)

25No man will be able to stand before you. The LORD your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you tread on, as he has spoken to you.


## Deuteronomy 11:26 (id: 1805011026)

26Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:


## Deuteronomy 11:27 (id: 1805011027)

27the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you today;


## Deuteronomy 11:28 (id: 1805011028)

28and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn away out of the way which I command you today, to go after other gods which you have not known.


## Deuteronomy 11:29 (id: 1805011029)

29It shall happen, when the LORD your God brings you into the land that you go to possess, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.


## Deuteronomy 11:30 (id: 1805011030)

30Aren’t they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?


## Deuteronomy 11:31 (id: 1805011031)

31For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God gives you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it.


## Deuteronomy 11:32 (id: 1805011032)

32You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you today.


## Deuteronomy 12:1 (id: 1805012001)

1These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess all the days that you live on the earth.


## Deuteronomy 12:2 (id: 1805012002)

2You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods: on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree.


## Deuteronomy 12:3 (id: 1805012003)

3You shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, and burn their Asherah poles with fire. You shall cut down the engraved images of their gods. You shall destroy their name out of that place.


## Deuteronomy 12:4 (id: 1805012004)

4You shall not do so to the LORD your God.


## Deuteronomy 12:5 (id: 1805012005)

7There you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which the LORD your God has blessed you.


## Deuteronomy 12:8 (id: 1805012008)

8You shall not do all the things that we do here today, every man whatever is right in his own eyes;


## Deuteronomy 12:9 (id: 1805012009)

9for you haven’t yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the LORD your God gives you.


## Deuteronomy 12:10 (id: 1805012010)

10But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the LORD your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety,


## Deuteronomy 12:11 (id: 1805012011)

11then it shall happen that to the place which the LORD your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD.


## Deuteronomy 12:12 (id: 1805012012)

## Deuteronomy 12:13 (id: 1805012013)

13Be careful that you don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;

14but in the place which the LORD chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.

## Deuteronomy 12:18 (id: 1805012018)

18but you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates. You shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hand to.


## Deuteronomy 12:19 (id: 1805012019)

21If the place which the LORD your God shall choose to put his name is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul.


## Deuteronomy 12:22 (id: 1805012022)

22Even as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so you shall eat of it. The unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.

## Deuteronomy 12:31 (id: 1805012031)

## Deuteronomy 12:32 (id: 1805012032)

32Whatever thing I command you, that you shall observe to do. You shall not add to it, nor take away from it.

## Deuteronomy 13:3 (id: 1805013003)

So you shall remove the evil from among you.


## Deuteronomy 13:6 (id: 1805013006)

## Deuteronomy 13:7 (id: 1805013007)

5as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood and his hand swings the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and hits his neighbor so that he dies—he shall flee to one of these cities and live.


## Deuteronomy 19:6 (id: 1805019006)

6Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer while hot anger is in his heart and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally, even though he was not worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past.


## Deuteronomy 19:7 (id: 1805019007)

7Therefore I command you to set apart three cities for yourselves.


## Deuteronomy 19:8 (id: 1805019008)

8If the LORD your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;


## Deuteronomy 19:9 (id: 1805019009)

9and if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you today, to love the LORD your God, and to walk ever in his ways, then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, in addition to these three.


## Deuteronomy 19:10 (id: 1805019010)

10This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, leaving blood guilt on you.


## Deuteronomy 19:11 (id: 1805019011)

11But if any man hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises up against him, strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities;


## Deuteronomy 19:12 (id: 1805019012)

12then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.


## Deuteronomy 19:13 (id: 1805019013)

13Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with you.


## Deuteronomy 19:14 (id: 1805019014)

14You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess.


## Deuteronomy 19:15 (id: 1805019015)

15One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin that he sins. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.


## Deuteronomy 19:16 (id: 1805019016)

16If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing,


## Deuteronomy 19:17 (id: 1805019017)

17then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;


## Deuteronomy 19:18 (id: 1805019018)

18and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother,


## Deuteronomy 19:19 (id: 1805019019)

19then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from among you.


## Deuteronomy 19:20 (id: 1805019020)

20Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil among you.


## Deuteronomy 19:21 (id: 1805019021)

21Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.


## Deuteronomy 20:1 (id: 1805020001)

1When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more numerous than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, is with you.

2It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,

## Deuteronomy 20:4 (id: 1805020004)

4for the LORD your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.”


## Deuteronomy 20:5 (id: 1805020005)

## Deuteronomy 20:6 (id: 1805020006)

6What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit.


## Deuteronomy 20:7 (id: 1805020007)

7What man is there who has pledged to be married to a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.”

## Deuteronomy 20:9 (id: 1805020009)

9It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.


## Deuteronomy 20:10 (id: 1805020010)

10When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.


## Deuteronomy 20:11 (id: 1805020011)

11It shall be, if it gives you answer of peace and opens to you, then it shall be that all the people who are found therein shall become forced laborers to you, and shall serve you.


## Deuteronomy 20:12 (id: 1805020012)

12If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it.


## Deuteronomy 20:13 (id: 1805020013)

13When the LORD your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword;


## Deuteronomy 20:14 (id: 1805020014)

14but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its plunder, you shall take for plunder for yourself. You may use the plunder of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.


## Deuteronomy 20:15 (id: 1805020015)

15Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.


## Deuteronomy 20:16 (id: 1805020016)

16But of the cities of these peoples that the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;


## Deuteronomy 20:17 (id: 1805020017)

17but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as the LORD your God has commanded you;


## Deuteronomy 20:18 (id: 1805020018)

18that they not teach you to follow all their abominations, which they have done for their gods; so would you sin against the LORD your God.


## Deuteronomy 20:19 (id: 1805020019)

19When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for you may eat of them. You shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged by you?


## Deuteronomy 20:20 (id: 1805020020)

20Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.


## Deuteronomy 21:1 (id: 1805021001)

1If someone is found slain in the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess, lying in the field, and it isn’t known who has struck him,


## Deuteronomy 21:2 (id: 1805021002)

2then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain.


## Deuteronomy 21:3 (id: 1805021003)

3It shall be that the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn’t been worked with and which has not drawn in the yoke.


## Deuteronomy 21:4 (id: 1805021004)

4The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.


## Deuteronomy 21:5 (id: 1805021005)

## Deuteronomy 21:10 (id: 1805021010)

10When you go out to battle against your enemies, and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you carry them away captive,

11and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to her, and desire to take her as your wife,

12then you shall bring her home to your house. She shall shave her head and trim her nails.


## Deuteronomy 21:13 (id: 1805021013)

13She shall take off the clothing of her captivity, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. After that you shall go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.


## Deuteronomy 21:14 (id: 1805021014)

14It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her.


## Deuteronomy 21:15 (id: 1805021015)

15If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated, and if the firstborn son is hers who was hated,


## Deuteronomy 21:16 (id: 1805021016)

16then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not give the son of the beloved the rights of the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn;


## Deuteronomy 21:17 (id: 1805021017)

17but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his.


## Deuteronomy 21:18 (id: 1805021018)

18If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them,

19then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place.


## Deuteronomy 21:20 (id: 1805021020)

20They shall tell the elders of his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”


## Deuteronomy 21:21 (id: 1805021021)

21All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall remove the evil from among you. All Israel shall hear, and fear.

22If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,


## Deuteronomy 21:23 (id: 1805021023)

10You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.


## Deuteronomy 22:11 (id: 1805022011)

11You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.


## Deuteronomy 22:12 (id: 1805022012)

15then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.


## Deuteronomy 22:16 (id: 1805022016)

20But if this thing is true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady,


## Deuteronomy 22:21 (id: 1805022021)

21then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father’s house. So you shall remove the evil from among you.


## Deuteronomy 22:22 (id: 1805022022)

## Deuteronomy 22:26 (id: 1805022026)

26but to the lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter;
