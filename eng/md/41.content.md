## Mark 1:1 (id: 1841001001)

1The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.


## Mark 1:2 (id: 1841001002)

2As it is written in the prophets, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you:


## Mark 1:3 (id: 1841001003)

3the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!’”


## Mark 1:4 (id: 1841001004)

4John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.


## Mark 1:5 (id: 1841001005)

5All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.


## Mark 1:6 (id: 1841001006)

6John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.


## Mark 1:7 (id: 1841001007)

7He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.


## Mark 1:8 (id: 1841001008)

8I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”


## Mark 1:9 (id: 1841001009)

9In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.


## Mark 1:10 (id: 1841001010)

10Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.


## Mark 1:11 (id: 1841001011)

11A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”


## Mark 1:12 (id: 1841001012)

12Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.


## Mark 1:13 (id: 1841001013)

13He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.


## Mark 1:14 (id: 1841001014)

14Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom,


## Mark 1:15 (id: 1841001015)

15and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”


## Mark 1:16 (id: 1841001016)

16Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.


## Mark 1:17 (id: 1841001017)

17Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”


## Mark 1:18 (id: 1841001018)

18Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.


## Mark 1:19 (id: 1841001019)

19Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.


## Mark 1:20 (id: 1841001020)

20Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.


## Mark 1:21 (id: 1841001021)

21They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.


## Mark 1:22 (id: 1841001022)

22They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.


## Mark 1:23 (id: 1841001023)

23Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,


## Mark 1:24 (id: 1841001024)

24saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!”


## Mark 1:25 (id: 1841001025)

25Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!”


## Mark 1:26 (id: 1841001026)

26The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.


## Mark 1:27 (id: 1841001027)

27They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”


## Mark 1:28 (id: 1841001028)

28The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.


## Mark 1:29 (id: 1841001029)

29Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.


## Mark 1:30 (id: 1841001030)

30Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.


## Mark 1:31 (id: 1841001031)

31He came and took her by the hand and raised her up. The fever left her immediately, and she served them.


## Mark 1:32 (id: 1841001032)

32At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.


## Mark 1:33 (id: 1841001033)

33All the city was gathered together at the door.


## Mark 1:34 (id: 1841001034)

34He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.


## Mark 1:35 (id: 1841001035)

35Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.


## Mark 1:36 (id: 1841001036)

36Simon and those who were with him searched for him.


## Mark 1:37 (id: 1841001037)

37They found him and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”


## Mark 1:38 (id: 1841001038)

38He said to them, “Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”


## Mark 1:39 (id: 1841001039)

39He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.


## Mark 1:40 (id: 1841001040)

40A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”


## Mark 1:41 (id: 1841001041)

41Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, “I want to. Be made clean.”


## Mark 1:42 (id: 1841001042)

42When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean.


## Mark 1:43 (id: 1841001043)

43He strictly warned him and immediately sent him out,


## Mark 1:44 (id: 1841001044)

44and said to him, “See that you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”


## Mark 1:45 (id: 1841001045)

45But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People came to him from everywhere.


## Mark 2:1 (id: 1841002001)

1When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was at home.


## Mark 2:2 (id: 1841002002)

2Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them.


## Mark 2:3 (id: 1841002003)

3Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.


## Mark 2:4 (id: 1841002004)

4When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.


## Mark 2:5 (id: 1841002005)

5Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”


## Mark 2:6 (id: 1841002006)

6But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,


## Mark 2:7 (id: 1841002007)

7“Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”


## Mark 2:8 (id: 1841002008)

8Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, “Why do you reason these things in your hearts?


## Mark 2:9 (id: 1841002009)

9Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and walk’?


## Mark 2:10 (id: 1841002010)

10But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—


## Mark 2:11 (id: 1841002011)

11“I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.”


## Mark 2:12 (id: 1841002012)

12He arose, and immediately took up the mat and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”


## Mark 2:13 (id: 1841002013)

13He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them.


## Mark 2:14 (id: 1841002014)

14As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. He said to him, “Followme.” And he arose and followed him.


## Mark 2:15 (id: 1841002015)

15He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.


## Mark 2:16 (id: 1841002016)

16The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”


## Mark 2:17 (id: 1841002017)

17When Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”


## Mark 2:18 (id: 1841002018)

18John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”


## Mark 2:19 (id: 1841002019)

19Jesus said to them, “Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.


## Mark 2:20 (id: 1841002020)

20But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.


## Mark 2:21 (id: 1841002021)

21No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.


## Mark 2:22 (id: 1841002022)

22No one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins.”


## Mark 2:23 (id: 1841002023)

23He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.


## Mark 2:24 (id: 1841002024)

24The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”


## Mark 2:25 (id: 1841002025)

25He said to them, “Did you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he, and those who were with him?


## Mark 2:26 (id: 1841002026)

26How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”


## Mark 2:27 (id: 1841002027)

27He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.


## Mark 2:28 (id: 1841002028)

28Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”


## Mark 3:1 (id: 1841003001)

1He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there whose hand was withered.


## Mark 3:2 (id: 1841003002)

2They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.


## Mark 3:3 (id: 1841003003)

3He said to the man whose hand was withered, “Stand up.”


## Mark 3:4 (id: 1841003004)

4He said to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do harm? To save a life or to kill?” But they were silent.


## Mark 3:5 (id: 1841003005)

5When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.


## Mark 3:6 (id: 1841003006)

6The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.


## Mark 3:7 (id: 1841003007)

7Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,


## Mark 3:8 (id: 1841003008)

8from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.


## Mark 3:9 (id: 1841003009)

9He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him.


## Mark 3:10 (id: 1841003010)

10For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.


## Mark 3:11 (id: 1841003011)

11The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him and cried, “You are the Son of God!”


## Mark 3:12 (id: 1841003012)

12He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.


## Mark 3:13 (id: 1841003013)

13He went up into the mountain and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.


## Mark 3:14 (id: 1841003014)

14He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach


## Mark 3:15 (id: 1841003015)

15and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:


## Mark 3:16 (id: 1841003016)

16Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);


## Mark 3:17 (id: 1841003017)

17James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder);


## Mark 3:18 (id: 1841003018)

18Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;


## Mark 3:19 (id: 1841003019)

19and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. Then he came into a house.


## Mark 3:20 (id: 1841003020)

20The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.


## Mark 3:21 (id: 1841003021)

21When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him; for they said, “He is insane.”


## Mark 3:22 (id: 1841003022)

22The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”


## Mark 3:23 (id: 1841003023)

23He summoned them and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?


## Mark 3:24 (id: 1841003024)

24If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.


## Mark 3:25 (id: 1841003025)

25If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.


## Mark 3:26 (id: 1841003026)

26If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end.


## Mark 3:27 (id: 1841003027)

27But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then he will plunder his house.


## Mark 3:28 (id: 1841003028)

28“Mostcertainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;


## Mark 3:29 (id: 1841003029)

29but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”


## Mark 3:30 (id: 1841003030)

30—because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”


## Mark 3:31 (id: 1841003031)

31His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.


## Mark 3:32 (id: 1841003032)

32A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you.”


## Mark 3:33 (id: 1841003033)

33He answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”


## Mark 3:34 (id: 1841003034)

34Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!


## Mark 3:35 (id: 1841003035)

35For whoever does the will of God is my brother, my sister, and mother.”


## Mark 4:1 (id: 1841004001)

1Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.


## Mark 4:2 (id: 1841004002)

2He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,


## Mark 4:3 (id: 1841004003)

3“Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow.


## Mark 4:4 (id: 1841004004)

4As he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.


## Mark 4:5 (id: 1841004005)

5Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.


## Mark 4:6 (id: 1841004006)

6When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.


## Mark 4:7 (id: 1841004007)

7Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.


## Mark 4:8 (id: 1841004008)

8Others fell into the good ground and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.”


## Mark 4:9 (id: 1841004009)

9He said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”


## Mark 4:10 (id: 1841004010)

10When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.


## Mark 4:11 (id: 1841004011)

11He said to them, “To you is given the mystery of God’s Kingdom, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,


## Mark 4:12 (id: 1841004012)

12that ‘seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.’”


## Mark 4:13 (id: 1841004013)

13He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?


## Mark 4:14 (id: 1841004014)

14The farmer sows the word.


## Mark 4:15 (id: 1841004015)

15The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.


## Mark 4:16 (id: 1841004016)

16These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.


## Mark 4:17 (id: 1841004017)

17They have no root in themselves, but are short\-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.


## Mark 4:18 (id: 1841004018)

18Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,


## Mark 4:19 (id: 1841004019)

19and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.


## Mark 4:20 (id: 1841004020)

20Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”


## Mark 4:21 (id: 1841004021)

21He said to them, “Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand?


## Mark 4:22 (id: 1841004022)

22For there is nothing hidden except that it should be made known, neither was anything made secret but that it should come to light.


## Mark 4:23 (id: 1841004023)

23If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.”


## Mark 4:24 (id: 1841004024)

24He said to them, “Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you; and more will be given to you who hear.


## Mark 4:25 (id: 1841004025)

25For whoever has, to him more will be given; and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”


## Mark 4:26 (id: 1841004026)

26He said, “God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,


## Mark 4:27 (id: 1841004027)

27and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn’t know how.


## Mark 4:28 (id: 1841004028)

28For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.


## Mark 4:29 (id: 1841004029)

29But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”


## Mark 4:30 (id: 1841004030)

30He said, “How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?


## Mark 4:31 (id: 1841004031)

31It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,


## Mark 4:32 (id: 1841004032)

32yet when it is sown, grows up and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”


## Mark 4:33 (id: 1841004033)

33With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.


## Mark 4:34 (id: 1841004034)

34Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.


## Mark 4:35 (id: 1841004035)

35On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side.”


## Mark 4:36 (id: 1841004036)

36Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.


## Mark 4:37 (id: 1841004037)

37A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.


## Mark 4:38 (id: 1841004038)

38He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and asked him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”


## Mark 4:39 (id: 1841004039)

39He awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased and there was a great calm.


## Mark 4:40 (id: 1841004040)

40He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”


## Mark 4:41 (id: 1841004041)

41They were greatly afraid and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”


## Mark 5:1 (id: 1841005001)

1They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.


## Mark 5:2 (id: 1841005002)

2When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.


## Mark 5:3 (id: 1841005003)

3He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,


## Mark 5:4 (id: 1841005004)

4because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.


## Mark 5:5 (id: 1841005005)

5Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.


## Mark 5:6 (id: 1841005006)

6When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,


## Mark 5:7 (id: 1841005007)

7and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.”


## Mark 5:8 (id: 1841005008)

8For he said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”


## Mark 5:9 (id: 1841005009)

9He asked him, “What is your name?” He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”


## Mark 5:10 (id: 1841005010)

10He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.


## Mark 5:11 (id: 1841005011)

11Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.


## Mark 5:12 (id: 1841005012)

12All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”


## Mark 5:13 (id: 1841005013)

13At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.


## Mark 5:14 (id: 1841005014)

14Those who fed the pigs fled, and told it in the city and in the country. The people came to see what it was that had happened.


## Mark 5:15 (id: 1841005015)

15They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.


## Mark 5:16 (id: 1841005016)

16Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.


## Mark 5:17 (id: 1841005017)

17They began to beg him to depart from their region.


## Mark 5:18 (id: 1841005018)

18As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.


## Mark 5:19 (id: 1841005019)

19He didn’t allow him, but said to him, “Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you.”


## Mark 5:20 (id: 1841005020)

20He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.


## Mark 5:21 (id: 1841005021)

21When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.


## Mark 5:22 (id: 1841005022)

22Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet


## Mark 5:23 (id: 1841005023)

23and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”


## Mark 5:24 (id: 1841005024)

24He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.


## Mark 5:25 (id: 1841005025)

25A certain woman who had a discharge of blood for twelve years,


## Mark 5:26 (id: 1841005026)

26and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,


## Mark 5:27 (id: 1841005027)

27having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes.


## Mark 5:28 (id: 1841005028)

28For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”


## Mark 5:29 (id: 1841005029)

29Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.


## Mark 5:30 (id: 1841005030)

30Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”


## Mark 5:31 (id: 1841005031)

31His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”


## Mark 5:32 (id: 1841005032)

32He looked around to see her who had done this thing.


## Mark 5:33 (id: 1841005033)

33But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.


## Mark 5:34 (id: 1841005034)

34He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”


## Mark 5:35 (id: 1841005035)

35While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”


## Mark 5:36 (id: 1841005036)

36But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Don’t be afraid, only believe.”


## Mark 5:37 (id: 1841005037)

37He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.


## Mark 5:38 (id: 1841005038)

38He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.


## Mark 5:39 (id: 1841005039)

39When he had entered in, he said to them, “Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”


## Mark 5:40 (id: 1841005040)

40They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.


## Mark 5:41 (id: 1841005041)

41Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “Talitha cumi!” which means, being interpreted, “Girl, I tell you, get up!”


## Mark 5:42 (id: 1841005042)

42Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.


## Mark 5:43 (id: 1841005043)

43He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.


## Mark 6:1 (id: 1841006001)

1He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.


## Mark 6:2 (id: 1841006002)

2When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things?” and, “What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?


## Mark 6:3 (id: 1841006003)

3Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” So they were offended at him.


## Mark 6:4 (id: 1841006004)

4Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.”


## Mark 6:5 (id: 1841006005)

5He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.


## Mark 6:6 (id: 1841006006)

6He marveled because of their unbelief. He went around the villages teaching.


## Mark 6:7 (id: 1841006007)

7He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.


## Mark 6:8 (id: 1841006008)

8He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,


## Mark 6:9 (id: 1841006009)

9but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.


## Mark 6:10 (id: 1841006010)

10He said to them, “Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.


## Mark 6:11 (id: 1841006011)

11Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!”


## Mark 6:12 (id: 1841006012)

12They went out and preached that people should repent.


## Mark 6:13 (id: 1841006013)

13They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick and healed them.


## Mark 6:14 (id: 1841006014)

14King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.”


## Mark 6:15 (id: 1841006015)

15But others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.”


## Mark 6:16 (id: 1841006016)

16But Herod, when he heard this, said, “This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.”


## Mark 6:17 (id: 1841006017)

17For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her.


## Mark 6:18 (id: 1841006018)

18For John had said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”


## Mark 6:19 (id: 1841006019)

19Herodias set herself against him and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t,


## Mark 6:20 (id: 1841006020)

20for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.


## Mark 6:21 (id: 1841006021)

21Then a convenient day came when Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.


## Mark 6:22 (id: 1841006022)

22When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”


## Mark 6:23 (id: 1841006023)

23He swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”


## Mark 6:24 (id: 1841006024)

24She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.”


## Mark 6:25 (id: 1841006025)

25She came in immediately with haste to the king and requested, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.”


## Mark 6:26 (id: 1841006026)

26The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her.


## Mark 6:27 (id: 1841006027)

27Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring John’s head; and he went and beheaded him in the prison,


## Mark 6:28 (id: 1841006028)

28and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.


## Mark 6:29 (id: 1841006029)

29When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.


## Mark 6:30 (id: 1841006030)

30The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.


## Mark 6:31 (id: 1841006031)

31He said to them, “Come away into a deserted place, and rest awhile.” For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.


## Mark 6:32 (id: 1841006032)

32They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.


## Mark 6:33 (id: 1841006033)

33They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.


## Mark 6:34 (id: 1841006034)

34Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.


## Mark 6:35 (id: 1841006035)

35When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.


## Mark 6:36 (id: 1841006036)

36Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”


## Mark 6:37 (id: 1841006037)

37But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?”


## Mark 6:38 (id: 1841006038)

38He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go see.” When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”


## Mark 6:39 (id: 1841006039)

39He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.


## Mark 6:40 (id: 1841006040)

40They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.


## Mark 6:41 (id: 1841006041)

41He took the five loaves and the two fish; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.


## Mark 6:42 (id: 1841006042)

42They all ate and were filled.


## Mark 6:43 (id: 1841006043)

43They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.


## Mark 6:44 (id: 1841006044)

44Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.


## Mark 6:45 (id: 1841006045)

45Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.


## Mark 6:46 (id: 1841006046)

46After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.


## Mark 6:47 (id: 1841006047)

47When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land.


## Mark 6:48 (id: 1841006048)

48Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them,


## Mark 6:49 (id: 1841006049)

49but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;


## Mark 6:50 (id: 1841006050)

50for they all saw him and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them and said to them, “Cheerup! It is I! Don’t be afraid.”


## Mark 6:51 (id: 1841006051)

51He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;


## Mark 6:52 (id: 1841006052)

52for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.


## Mark 6:53 (id: 1841006053)

53When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.


## Mark 6:54 (id: 1841006054)

54When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,


## Mark 6:55 (id: 1841006055)

55and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick on their mats to where they heard he was.


## Mark 6:56 (id: 1841006056)

56Wherever he entered—into villages, or into cities, or into the country—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.


## Mark 7:1 (id: 1841007001)

1Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.


## Mark 7:2 (id: 1841007002)

2Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault.


## Mark 7:3 (id: 1841007003)

3(For the Pharisees and all the Jews don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.


## Mark 7:4 (id: 1841007004)

4They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)


## Mark 7:5 (id: 1841007005)

5The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”


## Mark 7:6 (id: 1841007006)

6He answered them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.


## Mark 7:7 (id: 1841007007)

7They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’


## Mark 7:8 (id: 1841007008)

8“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”


## Mark 7:9 (id: 1841007009)

9He said to them, “Fullwell do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.


## Mark 7:10 (id: 1841007010)

10For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’


## Mark 7:11 (id: 1841007011)

11But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,”’” that is to say, given to God,


## Mark 7:12 (id: 1841007012)

12“then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,


## Mark 7:13 (id: 1841007013)

13making void the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”


## Mark 7:14 (id: 1841007014)

14He called all the multitude to himself and said to them, “Hearme, all of you, and understand.


## Mark 7:15 (id: 1841007015)

15There is nothing from outside of the man that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.


## Mark 7:16 (id: 1841007016)

16If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”


## Mark 7:17 (id: 1841007017)

17When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.


## Mark 7:18 (id: 1841007018)

18He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,


## Mark 7:19 (id: 1841007019)

19because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, making all foods clean?”


## Mark 7:20 (id: 1841007020)

20He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.


## Mark 7:21 (id: 1841007021)

21For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,


## Mark 7:22 (id: 1841007022)

22covetings,wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.


## Mark 7:23 (id: 1841007023)

23All these evil things come from within and defile the man.”


## Mark 7:24 (id: 1841007024)

24From there he arose and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.


## Mark 7:25 (id: 1841007025)

25For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.


## Mark 7:26 (id: 1841007026)

26Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.


## Mark 7:27 (id: 1841007027)

27But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”


## Mark 7:28 (id: 1841007028)

28But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”


## Mark 7:29 (id: 1841007029)

29He said to her, “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”


## Mark 7:30 (id: 1841007030)

30She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.


## Mark 7:31 (id: 1841007031)

31Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of the region of Decapolis.


## Mark 7:32 (id: 1841007032)

32They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.


## Mark 7:33 (id: 1841007033)

33He took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears; and he spat and touched his tongue.


## Mark 7:34 (id: 1841007034)

34Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”


## Mark 7:35 (id: 1841007035)

35Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.


## Mark 7:36 (id: 1841007036)

36He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.


## Mark 7:37 (id: 1841007037)

37They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”


## Mark 8:1 (id: 1841008001)

1In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself and said to them,


## Mark 8:2 (id: 1841008002)

2“I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days and have nothing to eat.


## Mark 8:3 (id: 1841008003)

3If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.”


## Mark 8:4 (id: 1841008004)

4His disciples answered him, “From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?”


## Mark 8:5 (id: 1841008005)

5He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”


## Mark 8:6 (id: 1841008006)

6He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.


## Mark 8:7 (id: 1841008007)

7They also had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.


## Mark 8:8 (id: 1841008008)

8They ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.


## Mark 8:9 (id: 1841008009)

9Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.


## Mark 8:10 (id: 1841008010)

10Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha.


## Mark 8:11 (id: 1841008011)

11The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven and testing him.


## Mark 8:12 (id: 1841008012)

12He sighed deeply in his spirit and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”


## Mark 8:13 (id: 1841008013)

13He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.


## Mark 8:14 (id: 1841008014)

14They forgot to take bread; and they didn’t have more than one loaf in the boat with them.


## Mark 8:15 (id: 1841008015)

15He warned them, saying, “Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.”


## Mark 8:16 (id: 1841008016)

16They reasoned with one another, saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”


## Mark 8:17 (id: 1841008017)

17Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, “Why do you reason that it’s because you have no bread? Don’t you perceive yet or understand? Is your heart still hardened?


## Mark 8:18 (id: 1841008018)

18Having eyes, don’t you see? Having ears, don’t you hear? Don’t you remember?


## Mark 8:19 (id: 1841008019)

19When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They told him, “Twelve.”


## Mark 8:20 (id: 1841008020)

20“When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They told him, “Seven.”


## Mark 8:21 (id: 1841008021)

21He asked them, “Don’tyou understand yet?”


## Mark 8:22 (id: 1841008022)

22He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him.


## Mark 8:23 (id: 1841008023)

23He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spat on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.


## Mark 8:24 (id: 1841008024)

24He looked up, and said, “I see men, but I see them like walking trees.”


## Mark 8:25 (id: 1841008025)

25Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.


## Mark 8:26 (id: 1841008026)

26He sent him away to his house, saying, “Don’t enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village.”


## Mark 8:27 (id: 1841008027)

27Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do men say that I am?”


## Mark 8:28 (id: 1841008028)

28They told him, “John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others, one of the prophets.”


## Mark 8:29 (id: 1841008029)

29He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”


## Mark 8:30 (id: 1841008030)

30He commanded them that they should tell no one about him.


## Mark 8:31 (id: 1841008031)

31He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.


## Mark 8:32 (id: 1841008032)

32He spoke to them openly. Peter took him and began to rebuke him.


## Mark 8:33 (id: 1841008033)

33But he, turning around and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.”


## Mark 8:34 (id: 1841008034)

34He called the multitude to himself with his disciples and said to them, “Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.


## Mark 8:35 (id: 1841008035)

35For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.


## Mark 8:36 (id: 1841008036)

36For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?


## Mark 8:37 (id: 1841008037)

37For what will a man give in exchange for his life?


## Mark 8:38 (id: 1841008038)

38For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.”


## Mark 9:1 (id: 1841009001)

1He said to them, “Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see God’s Kingdom come with power.”


## Mark 9:2 (id: 1841009002)

2After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.


## Mark 9:3 (id: 1841009003)

3His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.


## Mark 9:4 (id: 1841009004)

4Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.


## Mark 9:5 (id: 1841009005)

5Peter answered Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”


## Mark 9:6 (id: 1841009006)

6For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.


## Mark 9:7 (id: 1841009007)

7A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”


## Mark 9:8 (id: 1841009008)

8Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.


## Mark 9:9 (id: 1841009009)

9As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.


## Mark 9:10 (id: 1841009010)

10They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.


## Mark 9:11 (id: 1841009011)

11They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”


## Mark 9:12 (id: 1841009012)

12He said to them, “Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?


## Mark 9:13 (id: 1841009013)

13But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.”


## Mark 9:14 (id: 1841009014)

14Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.


## Mark 9:15 (id: 1841009015)

15Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, greeted him.


## Mark 9:16 (id: 1841009016)

16He asked the scribes, “What are you asking them?”


## Mark 9:17 (id: 1841009017)

17One of the multitude answered, “Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;


## Mark 9:18 (id: 1841009018)

18and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t able.”


## Mark 9:19 (id: 1841009019)

19He answered him, “Unbelievinggeneration, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.”


## Mark 9:20 (id: 1841009020)

20They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.


## Mark 9:21 (id: 1841009021)

21He asked his father, “How long has it been since this has been happening to him?” He said, “From childhood.


## Mark 9:22 (id: 1841009022)

22Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”


## Mark 9:23 (id: 1841009023)

23Jesus said to him, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.”


## Mark 9:24 (id: 1841009024)

24Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!”


## Mark 9:25 (id: 1841009025)

25When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, “You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!”


## Mark 9:26 (id: 1841009026)

26After crying out and convulsing him greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead, so much that most of them said, “He is dead.”


## Mark 9:27 (id: 1841009027)

27But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up; and he arose.


## Mark 9:28 (id: 1841009028)

28When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”


## Mark 9:29 (id: 1841009029)

29He said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing but by prayer and fasting.”


## Mark 9:30 (id: 1841009030)

30They went out from there and passed through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know it,


## Mark 9:31 (id: 1841009031)

31for he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, “The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again.”


## Mark 9:32 (id: 1841009032)

32But they didn’t understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.


## Mark 9:33 (id: 1841009033)

33He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?”


## Mark 9:34 (id: 1841009034)

34But they were silent, for they had disputed with one another on the way about who was the greatest.


## Mark 9:35 (id: 1841009035)

35He sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, “If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.”


## Mark 9:36 (id: 1841009036)

36He took a little child and set him in the middle of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,


## Mark 9:37 (id: 1841009037)

37“Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, doesn’t receive me, but him who sent me.”


## Mark 9:38 (id: 1841009038)

38John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone who doesn’t follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow us.”


## Mark 9:39 (id: 1841009039)

39But Jesus said, “Don’t forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name and be able quickly to speak evil of me.


## Mark 9:40 (id: 1841009040)

40For whoever is not against us is on our side.


## Mark 9:41 (id: 1841009041)

41For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christ’s, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.


## Mark 9:42 (id: 1841009042)

42“Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.


## Mark 9:43 (id: 1841009043)

43If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire,


## Mark 9:44 (id: 1841009044)

44‘where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire is not quenched.’


## Mark 9:45 (id: 1841009045)

45If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched—


## Mark 9:46 (id: 1841009046)

46‘where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire is not quenched.’


## Mark 9:47 (id: 1841009047)

47If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out. It is better for you to enter into God’s Kingdom with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire,


## Mark 9:48 (id: 1841009048)

48‘where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire is not quenched.’


## Mark 9:49 (id: 1841009049)

49For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.


## Mark 9:50 (id: 1841009050)

50Saltis good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”


## Mark 10:1 (id: 1841010001)

1He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.


## Mark 10:2 (id: 1841010002)

2Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”


## Mark 10:3 (id: 1841010003)

3He answered, “What did Moses command you?”


## Mark 10:4 (id: 1841010004)

4They said, “Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.”


## Mark 10:5 (id: 1841010005)

5But Jesus said to them, “For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.


## Mark 10:6 (id: 1841010006)

6But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.


## Mark 10:7 (id: 1841010007)

7For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,


## Mark 10:8 (id: 1841010008)

8and the two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.


## Mark 10:9 (id: 1841010009)

9What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”


## Mark 10:10 (id: 1841010010)

10In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.


## Mark 10:11 (id: 1841010011)

11He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.


## Mark 10:12 (id: 1841010012)

12If a woman herself divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”


## Mark 10:13 (id: 1841010013)

13They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.


## Mark 10:14 (id: 1841010014)

14But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation and said to them, “Allowthe little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these.


## Mark 10:15 (id: 1841010015)

15Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”


## Mark 10:16 (id: 1841010016)

16He took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.


## Mark 10:17 (id: 1841010017)

17As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”


## Mark 10:18 (id: 1841010018)

18Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except one—God.


## Mark 10:19 (id: 1841010019)

19You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”


## Mark 10:20 (id: 1841010020)

20He said to him, “Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.”


## Mark 10:21 (id: 1841010021)

21Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, “One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.”


## Mark 10:22 (id: 1841010022)

22But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.


## Mark 10:23 (id: 1841010023)

23Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!”


## Mark 10:24 (id: 1841010024)

24The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, “Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!


## Mark 10:25 (id: 1841010025)

25It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”


## Mark 10:26 (id: 1841010026)

26They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”


## Mark 10:27 (id: 1841010027)

27Jesus, looking at them, said, “With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.”


## Mark 10:28 (id: 1841010028)

28Peter began to tell him, “Behold, we have left all and have followed you.”


## Mark 10:29 (id: 1841010029)

29Jesus said, “Mostcertainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,


## Mark 10:30 (id: 1841010030)

30but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time: houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.


## Mark 10:31 (id: 1841010031)

31But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”


## Mark 10:32 (id: 1841010032)

32They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.


## Mark 10:33 (id: 1841010033)

33“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.


## Mark 10:34 (id: 1841010034)

34They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”


## Mark 10:35 (id: 1841010035)

35James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask.”


## Mark 10:36 (id: 1841010036)

36He said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”


## Mark 10:37 (id: 1841010037)

37They said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left hand, in your glory.”


## Mark 10:38 (id: 1841010038)

38But Jesus said to them, “You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”


## Mark 10:39 (id: 1841010039)

39They said to him, “We are able.” Jesus said to them, “You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;


## Mark 10:40 (id: 1841010040)

40but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.”


## Mark 10:41 (id: 1841010041)

41When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant toward James and John.


## Mark 10:42 (id: 1841010042)

42Jesus summoned them and said to them, “You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.


## Mark 10:43 (id: 1841010043)

43But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.


## Mark 10:44 (id: 1841010044)

44Whoever of you wants to become first among you shall be bondservant of all.


## Mark 10:45 (id: 1841010045)

45For the Son of Man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”


## Mark 10:46 (id: 1841010046)

46They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.


## Mark 10:47 (id: 1841010047)

47When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”


## Mark 10:48 (id: 1841010048)

48Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!”


## Mark 10:49 (id: 1841010049)

49Jesus stood still and said, “Call him.” They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!”


## Mark 10:50 (id: 1841010050)

50He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.


## Mark 10:51 (id: 1841010051)

51Jesus asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “Rabboni, that I may see again.”


## Mark 10:52 (id: 1841010052)

52Jesus said to him, “Go your way. Your faith has made you well.” Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the way.


## Mark 11:1 (id: 1841011001)

1When they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples


## Mark 11:2 (id: 1841011002)

2and said to them, “Go your way into the village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him and bring him.


## Mark 11:3 (id: 1841011003)

3If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs him;’ and immediately he will send him back here.”


## Mark 11:4 (id: 1841011004)

4They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him.


## Mark 11:5 (id: 1841011005)

5Some of those who stood there asked them, “What are you doing, untying the young donkey?”


## Mark 11:6 (id: 1841011006)

6They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.


## Mark 11:7 (id: 1841011007)

7They brought the young donkey to Jesus and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it.


## Mark 11:8 (id: 1841011008)

8Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.


## Mark 11:9 (id: 1841011009)

9Those who went in front and those who followed cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!


## Mark 11:10 (id: 1841011010)

10Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”


## Mark 11:11 (id: 1841011011)

11Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.


## Mark 11:12 (id: 1841011012)

12The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry.


## Mark 11:13 (id: 1841011013)

13Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.


## Mark 11:14 (id: 1841011014)

14Jesus told it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” and his disciples heard it.


## Mark 11:15 (id: 1841011015)

15They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.


## Mark 11:16 (id: 1841011016)

16He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple.


## Mark 11:17 (id: 1841011017)

17He taught, saying to them, “Isn’t it written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers!”


## Mark 11:18 (id: 1841011018)

18The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.


## Mark 11:19 (id: 1841011019)

19When evening came, he went out of the city.


## Mark 11:20 (id: 1841011020)

20As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.


## Mark 11:21 (id: 1841011021)

21Peter, remembering, said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away.”


## Mark 11:22 (id: 1841011022)

22Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God.


## Mark 11:23 (id: 1841011023)

23For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and doesn’t doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening, he shall have whatever he says.


## Mark 11:24 (id: 1841011024)

24Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.


## Mark 11:25 (id: 1841011025)

25Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.


## Mark 11:26 (id: 1841011026)

26But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions.”


## Mark 11:27 (id: 1841011027)

27They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him,


## Mark 11:28 (id: 1841011028)

28and they began saying to him, “By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?”


## Mark 11:29 (id: 1841011029)

29Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.


## Mark 11:30 (id: 1841011030)

30The baptism of John—was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.”


## Mark 11:31 (id: 1841011031)

31They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘From heaven;’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’


## Mark 11:32 (id: 1841011032)

32If we should say, ‘From men’”—they feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet.


## Mark 11:33 (id: 1841011033)

33They answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”


## Mark 12:1 (id: 1841012001)

1He began to speak to them in parables. “A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.


## Mark 12:2 (id: 1841012002)

2When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.


## Mark 12:3 (id: 1841012003)

3They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.


## Mark 12:4 (id: 1841012004)

4Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.


## Mark 12:5 (id: 1841012005)

5Again he sent another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some, and killing some.


## Mark 12:6 (id: 1841012006)

6Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’


## Mark 12:7 (id: 1841012007)

7But those farmers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’


## Mark 12:8 (id: 1841012008)

8They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.


## Mark 12:9 (id: 1841012009)

9What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.


## Mark 12:10 (id: 1841012010)

10Haven’t you even read this Scripture: ‘The stone which the builders rejected was made the head of the corner.


## Mark 12:11 (id: 1841012011)

11This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in our eyes’?”


## Mark 12:12 (id: 1841012012)

12They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him and went away.


## Mark 12:13 (id: 1841012013)

13They sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.


## Mark 12:14 (id: 1841012014)

14When they had come, they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?


## Mark 12:15 (id: 1841012015)

15Shall we give, or shall we not give?” But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”


## Mark 12:16 (id: 1841012016)

16They brought it. He said to them, “Whose is this image and inscription?” They said to him, “Caesar’s.”


## Mark 12:17 (id: 1841012017)

17Jesus answered them, “Renderto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” They marveled greatly at him.


## Mark 12:18 (id: 1841012018)

18Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying,


## Mark 12:19 (id: 1841012019)

19“Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’


## Mark 12:20 (id: 1841012020)

20There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.


## Mark 12:21 (id: 1841012021)

21The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;


## Mark 12:22 (id: 1841012022)

22and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.


## Mark 12:23 (id: 1841012023)

23In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”


## Mark 12:24 (id: 1841012024)

24Jesus answered them, “Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God?


## Mark 12:25 (id: 1841012025)

25For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.


## Mark 12:26 (id: 1841012026)

26But about the dead, that they are raised, haven’t you read in the book of Moses about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?


## Mark 12:27 (id: 1841012027)

27He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”


## Mark 12:28 (id: 1841012028)

28One of the scribes came and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”


## Mark 12:29 (id: 1841012029)

29Jesus answered, “The greatest is: ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.


## Mark 12:30 (id: 1841012030)

30You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment.


## Mark 12:31 (id: 1841012031)

31The second is like this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”


## Mark 12:32 (id: 1841012032)

32The scribe said to him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he;


## Mark 12:33 (id: 1841012033)

33and to love him with all the heart, with all the understanding, all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”


## Mark 12:34 (id: 1841012034)

34When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from God’s Kingdom.” No one dared ask him any question after that.


## Mark 12:35 (id: 1841012035)

35Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?


## Mark 12:36 (id: 1841012036)

36For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.”’


## Mark 12:37 (id: 1841012037)

37Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?” The common people heard him gladly.


## Mark 12:38 (id: 1841012038)

38In his teaching he said to them, “Bewareof the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,


## Mark 12:39 (id: 1841012039)

39and to get the best seats in the synagogues and the best places at feasts,


## Mark 12:40 (id: 1841012040)

40those who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”


## Mark 12:41 (id: 1841012041)

41Jesus sat down opposite the treasury and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.


## Mark 12:42 (id: 1841012042)

42A poor widow came and she cast in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin.


## Mark 12:43 (id: 1841012043)

43He called his disciples to himself and said to them, “Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,


## Mark 12:44 (id: 1841012044)

44for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.”


## Mark 13:1 (id: 1841013001)

1As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!”


## Mark 13:2 (id: 1841013002)

2Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.”


## Mark 13:3 (id: 1841013003)

3As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,


## Mark 13:4 (id: 1841013004)

4“Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?”


## Mark 13:5 (id: 1841013005)

5Jesus, answering, began to tell them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray.


## Mark 13:6 (id: 1841013006)

6For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’ and will lead many astray.


## Mark 13:7 (id: 1841013007)

7“When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.


## Mark 13:8 (id: 1841013008)

8For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.


## Mark 13:9 (id: 1841013009)

9“But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.


## Mark 13:10 (id: 1841013010)

10The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.


## Mark 13:11 (id: 1841013011)

11When they lead you away and deliver you up, don’t be anxious beforehand or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.


## Mark 13:12 (id: 1841013012)

12“Brotherwill deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.


## Mark 13:13 (id: 1841013013)

13You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.


## Mark 13:14 (id: 1841013014)

14“But when you see the abomination of desolation, spokenof by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not” (let the reader understand), “then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,


## Mark 13:15 (id: 1841013015)

15and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.


## Mark 13:16 (id: 1841013016)

16Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.


## Mark 13:17 (id: 1841013017)

17But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!


## Mark 13:18 (id: 1841013018)

18Pray that your flight won’t be in the winter.


## Mark 13:19 (id: 1841013019)

19For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.


## Mark 13:20 (id: 1841013020)

20Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.


## Mark 13:21 (id: 1841013021)

21Then if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ don’t believe it.


## Mark 13:22 (id: 1841013022)

22For false christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.


## Mark 13:23 (id: 1841013023)

23But you watch. “Behold,I have told you all things beforehand.


## Mark 13:24 (id: 1841013024)

24But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,


## Mark 13:25 (id: 1841013025)

25the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.


## Mark 13:26 (id: 1841013026)

26Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.


## Mark 13:27 (id: 1841013027)

27Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.


## Mark 13:28 (id: 1841013028)

28“Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender and produces its leaves, you know that the summer is near;


## Mark 13:29 (id: 1841013029)

29even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.


## Mark 13:30 (id: 1841013030)

30Mostcertainly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.


## Mark 13:31 (id: 1841013031)

31Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.


## Mark 13:32 (id: 1841013032)

32“But of that day or that hour no one knows—not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.


## Mark 13:33 (id: 1841013033)

33Watch, keep alert,and pray; for you don’t know when the time is.


## Mark 13:34 (id: 1841013034)

34“It is like a man traveling to another country, having left his house and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.


## Mark 13:35 (id: 1841013035)

35Watch therefore, for you don’t know when the lord of the house is coming—whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;


## Mark 13:36 (id: 1841013036)

36lest, coming suddenly, he might find you sleeping.


## Mark 13:37 (id: 1841013037)

37What I tell you, I tell all: Watch!”


## Mark 14:1 (id: 1841014001)

1It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception and kill him.


## Mark 14:2 (id: 1841014002)

2For they said, “Not during the feast, because there might be a riot among the people.”


## Mark 14:3 (id: 1841014003)

3While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She broke the jar and poured it over his head.


## Mark 14:4 (id: 1841014004)

4But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?


## Mark 14:5 (id: 1841014005)

5For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” So they grumbled against her.


## Mark 14:6 (id: 1841014006)

6But Jesus said, “Leaveher alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.


## Mark 14:7 (id: 1841014007)

7For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.


## Mark 14:8 (id: 1841014008)

8She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.


## Mark 14:9 (id: 1841014009)

9Mostcertainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.”


## Mark 14:10 (id: 1841014010)

10Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.


## Mark 14:11 (id: 1841014011)

11They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.


## Mark 14:12 (id: 1841014012)

12On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover?”


## Mark 14:13 (id: 1841014013)

13He sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him,


## Mark 14:14 (id: 1841014014)

14and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’


## Mark 14:15 (id: 1841014015)

15He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”


## Mark 14:16 (id: 1841014016)

16His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.


## Mark 14:17 (id: 1841014017)

17When it was evening he came with the twelve.


## Mark 14:18 (id: 1841014018)

18As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, “Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me—he who eats with me.”


## Mark 14:19 (id: 1841014019)

19They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another said, “Surely not I?”


## Mark 14:20 (id: 1841014020)

20He answered them, “It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.


## Mark 14:21 (id: 1841014021)

21For the Son of Man goes as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”


## Mark 14:22 (id: 1841014022)

22As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed it, he broke it and gave to them, and said, “Take, eat. This is my body.”


## Mark 14:23 (id: 1841014023)

23He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.


## Mark 14:24 (id: 1841014024)

24He said to them, “This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.


## Mark 14:25 (id: 1841014025)

25Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in God’s Kingdom.”


## Mark 14:26 (id: 1841014026)

26When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.


## Mark 14:27 (id: 1841014027)

27Jesus said to them, “All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’


## Mark 14:28 (id: 1841014028)

28However,after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”


## Mark 14:29 (id: 1841014029)

29But Peter said to him, “Although all will be offended, yet I will not.”


## Mark 14:30 (id: 1841014030)

30Jesus said to him, “Mostcertainly I tell you that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”


## Mark 14:31 (id: 1841014031)

31But he spoke all the more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the same thing.


## Mark 14:32 (id: 1841014032)

32They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”


## Mark 14:33 (id: 1841014033)

33He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.


## Mark 14:34 (id: 1841014034)

34He said to them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch.”


## Mark 14:35 (id: 1841014035)

35He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.


## Mark 14:36 (id: 1841014036)

36He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.”


## Mark 14:37 (id: 1841014037)

37He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour?


## Mark 14:38 (id: 1841014038)

38Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”


## Mark 14:39 (id: 1841014039)

39Again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.


## Mark 14:40 (id: 1841014040)

40Again he returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they didn’t know what to answer him.


## Mark 14:41 (id: 1841014041)

41He came the third time and said to them, “Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.


## Mark 14:42 (id: 1841014042)

42Arise! Let’s get going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”


## Mark 14:43 (id: 1841014043)

43Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.


## Mark 14:44 (id: 1841014044)

44Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.”


## Mark 14:45 (id: 1841014045)

45When he had come, immediately he came to him and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him.


## Mark 14:46 (id: 1841014046)

46They laid their hands on him and seized him.


## Mark 14:47 (id: 1841014047)

47But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.


## Mark 14:48 (id: 1841014048)

48Jesus answered them, “Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?


## Mark 14:49 (id: 1841014049)

49I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”


## Mark 14:50 (id: 1841014050)

50They all left him, and fled.


## Mark 14:51 (id: 1841014051)

51A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,


## Mark 14:52 (id: 1841014052)

52but he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.


## Mark 14:53 (id: 1841014053)

53They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.


## Mark 14:54 (id: 1841014054)

54Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.


## Mark 14:55 (id: 1841014055)

55Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.


## Mark 14:56 (id: 1841014056)

56For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other.


## Mark 14:57 (id: 1841014057)

57Some stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,


## Mark 14:58 (id: 1841014058)

58“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’”


## Mark 14:59 (id: 1841014059)

59Even so, their testimony didn’t agree.


## Mark 14:60 (id: 1841014060)

60The high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?”


## Mark 14:61 (id: 1841014061)

61But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”


## Mark 14:62 (id: 1841014062)

62Jesus said, “I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.”


## Mark 14:63 (id: 1841014063)

63The high priest tore his clothes and said, “What further need have we of witnesses?


## Mark 14:64 (id: 1841014064)

64You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death.


## Mark 14:65 (id: 1841014065)

65Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.


## Mark 14:66 (id: 1841014066)

66As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,


## Mark 14:67 (id: 1841014067)

67and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!”


## Mark 14:68 (id: 1841014068)

68But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.


## Mark 14:69 (id: 1841014069)

69The maid saw him and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.”


## Mark 14:70 (id: 1841014070)

70But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.”


## Mark 14:71 (id: 1841014071)

71But he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!”


## Mark 14:72 (id: 1841014072)

72The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the words that Jesus said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he thought about that, he wept.


## Mark 15:1 (id: 1841015001)

1Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.


## Mark 15:2 (id: 1841015002)

2Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered, “So you say.”


## Mark 15:3 (id: 1841015003)

3The chief priests accused him of many things.


## Mark 15:4 (id: 1841015004)

4Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”


## Mark 15:5 (id: 1841015005)

5But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.


## Mark 15:6 (id: 1841015006)

6Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomever they asked of him.


## Mark 15:7 (id: 1841015007)

7There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.


## Mark 15:8 (id: 1841015008)

8The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.


## Mark 15:9 (id: 1841015009)

9Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”


## Mark 15:10 (id: 1841015010)

10For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.


## Mark 15:11 (id: 1841015011)

11But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.


## Mark 15:12 (id: 1841015012)

12Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”


## Mark 15:13 (id: 1841015013)

13They cried out again, “Crucify him!”


## Mark 15:14 (id: 1841015014)

14Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”


## Mark 15:15 (id: 1841015015)

15Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.


## Mark 15:16 (id: 1841015016)

16The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.


## Mark 15:17 (id: 1841015017)

17They clothed him with purple; and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.


## Mark 15:18 (id: 1841015018)

18They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”


## Mark 15:19 (id: 1841015019)

19They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.


## Mark 15:20 (id: 1841015020)

20When they had mocked him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.


## Mark 15:21 (id: 1841015021)

21They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross.


## Mark 15:22 (id: 1841015022)

22They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”


## Mark 15:23 (id: 1841015023)

23They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.


## Mark 15:24 (id: 1841015024)

24Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.


## Mark 15:25 (id: 1841015025)

25It was the third hour when they crucified him.


## Mark 15:26 (id: 1841015026)

26The superscription of his accusation was written over him: “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”


## Mark 15:27 (id: 1841015027)

27With him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.


## Mark 15:28 (id: 1841015028)

28The Scripture was fulfilled which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”


## Mark 15:29 (id: 1841015029)

29Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,


## Mark 15:30 (id: 1841015030)

30save yourself, and come down from the cross!”


## Mark 15:31 (id: 1841015031)

31Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself.


## Mark 15:32 (id: 1841015032)

32Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.” Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.


## Mark 15:33 (id: 1841015033)

33When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.


## Mark 15:34 (id: 1841015034)

34At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”


## Mark 15:35 (id: 1841015035)

35Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”


## Mark 15:36 (id: 1841015036)

36One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”


## Mark 15:37 (id: 1841015037)

37Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.


## Mark 15:38 (id: 1841015038)

38The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.


## Mark 15:39 (id: 1841015039)

39When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”


## Mark 15:40 (id: 1841015040)

40There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;


## Mark 15:41 (id: 1841015041)

41who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.


## Mark 15:42 (id: 1841015042)

42When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,


## Mark 15:43 (id: 1841015043)

43Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.


## Mark 15:44 (id: 1841015044)

44Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.


## Mark 15:45 (id: 1841015045)

45When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.


## Mark 15:46 (id: 1841015046)

46He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.


## Mark 15:47 (id: 1841015047)

47Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.


## Mark 16:1 (id: 1841016001)

1When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.


## Mark 16:2 (id: 1841016002)

2Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.


## Mark 16:3 (id: 1841016003)

3They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?”


## Mark 16:4 (id: 1841016004)

4for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.


## Mark 16:5 (id: 1841016005)

5Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed.


## Mark 16:6 (id: 1841016006)

6He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him!


## Mark 16:7 (id: 1841016007)

7But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’”


## Mark 16:8 (id: 1841016008)

8They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.


## Mark 16:9 (id: 1841016009)

9Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.


## Mark 16:10 (id: 1841016010)

10She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.


## Mark 16:11 (id: 1841016011)

11When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.


## Mark 16:12 (id: 1841016012)

12After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them as they walked, on their way into the country.


## Mark 16:13 (id: 1841016013)

13They went away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.


## Mark 16:14 (id: 1841016014)

14Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table; and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he had risen.


## Mark 16:15 (id: 1841016015)

15He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the Good News to the whole creation.


## Mark 16:16 (id: 1841016016)

16He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.


## Mark 16:17 (id: 1841016017)

17These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;


## Mark 16:18 (id: 1841016018)

18they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”


## Mark 16:19 (id: 1841016019)

19So then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.


## Mark 16:20 (id: 1841016020)

20They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
