## Exodus 1:1 (id: 1802001001)

1Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):


## Exodus 1:2 (id: 1802001002)

2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,


## Exodus 1:3 (id: 1802001003)

3Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,


## Exodus 1:4 (id: 1802001004)

4Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.


## Exodus 1:5 (id: 1802001005)

5All the souls who came out of Jacob’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already.


## Exodus 1:6 (id: 1802001006)

6Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.


## Exodus 1:7 (id: 1802001007)

7The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.


## Exodus 1:8 (id: 1802001008)

8Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn’t know Joseph.


## Exodus 1:9 (id: 1802001009)

9He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.


## Exodus 1:10 (id: 1802001010)

10Come, let’s deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies and fight against us, and escape out of the land.”


## Exodus 1:11 (id: 1802001011)

11Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.


## Exodus 1:12 (id: 1802001012)

12But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They started to dread the children of Israel.


## Exodus 1:13 (id: 1802001013)

13The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,


## Exodus 1:14 (id: 1802001014)

14and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.


## Exodus 1:15 (id: 1802001015)

15The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,


## Exodus 1:16 (id: 1802001016)

16and he said, “When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.”


## Exodus 1:17 (id: 1802001017)

17But the midwives feared God, and didn’t do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.


## Exodus 1:18 (id: 1802001018)

18The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and saved the boys alive?”


## Exodus 1:19 (id: 1802001019)

19The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”


## Exodus 1:20 (id: 1802001020)

20God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.


## Exodus 1:21 (id: 1802001021)

21Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.


## Exodus 1:22 (id: 1802001022)

22Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”


## Exodus 2:1 (id: 1802002001)

1A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife.


## Exodus 2:2 (id: 1802002002)

2The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.


## Exodus 2:3 (id: 1802002003)

3When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank.


## Exodus 2:4 (id: 1802002004)

4His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him.


## Exodus 2:5 (id: 1802002005)

5Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her servant to get it.


## Exodus 2:6 (id: 1802002006)

6She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”


## Exodus 2:7 (id: 1802002007)

7Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?”


## Exodus 2:8 (id: 1802002008)

8Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” The young woman went and called the child’s mother.


## Exodus 2:9 (id: 1802002009)

9Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” The woman took the child, and nursed it.


## Exodus 2:10 (id: 1802002010)

10The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”


## Exodus 2:11 (id: 1802002011)

11In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.


## Exodus 2:12 (id: 1802002012)

12He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.


## Exodus 2:13 (id: 1802002013)

13He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?”


## Exodus 2:14 (id: 1802002014)

14He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses was afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.”


## Exodus 2:15 (id: 1802002015)

15Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.


## Exodus 2:16 (id: 1802002016)

16Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.


## Exodus 2:17 (id: 1802002017)

17The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.


## Exodus 2:18 (id: 1802002018)

18When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?”


## Exodus 2:19 (id: 1802002019)

19They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.”


## Exodus 2:20 (id: 1802002020)

20He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”


## Exodus 2:21 (id: 1802002021)

21Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.


## Exodus 2:22 (id: 1802002022)

22She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.”


## Exodus 2:23 (id: 1802002023)

23In the course of those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.


## Exodus 2:24 (id: 1802002024)

24God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.


## Exodus 2:25 (id: 1802002025)

25God saw the children of Israel, and God understood.


## Exodus 3:1 (id: 1802003001)

1Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father\-in\-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God’s mountain, to Horeb.


## Exodus 3:2 (id: 1802003002)

2The LORD’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.


## Exodus 3:3 (id: 1802003003)

3Moses said, “I will go now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.”


## Exodus 3:4 (id: 1802003004)

4When the LORD saw that he came over to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, “Moses! Moses!” He said, “Here I am.”


## Exodus 3:5 (id: 1802003005)

5He said, “Don’t come close. Take off your sandals, for the place you are standing on is holy ground.”


## Exodus 3:6 (id: 1802003006)

6Moreover he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.


## Exodus 3:7 (id: 1802003007)

7The LORD said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.


## Exodus 3:8 (id: 1802003008)

8I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.


## Exodus 3:9 (id: 1802003009)

9Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.


## Exodus 3:10 (id: 1802003010)

10Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”


## Exodus 3:11 (id: 1802003011)

11Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”


## Exodus 3:12 (id: 1802003012)

12He said, “Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.”


## Exodus 3:13 (id: 1802003013)

13Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what should I tell them?”


## Exodus 3:14 (id: 1802003014)

14God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM,” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel this: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”

15God said moreover to Moses, “You shall tell the children of Israel this, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.


## Exodus 3:16 (id: 1802003016)

16Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.


## Exodus 3:17 (id: 1802003017)

## Exodus 3:18 (id: 1802003018)

18They will listen to your voice. You shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD, our God.’


## Exodus 3:19 (id: 1802003019)

19I know that the king of Egypt won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.


## Exodus 3:20 (id: 1802003020)

20I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will let you go.

## Exodus 4:4 (id: 1802004004)

## Exodus 5:2 (id: 1802005002)

2Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don’t know the LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.”


## Exodus 5:3 (id: 1802005003)

## Exodus 5:4 (id: 1802005004)

4The king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!”


## Exodus 5:5 (id: 1802005005)

5Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.”


## Exodus 5:6 (id: 1802005006)

6The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,


## Exodus 5:7 (id: 1802005007)

7“You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.


## Exodus 5:8 (id: 1802005008)

8You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to our God.’


## Exodus 5:9 (id: 1802005009)

9Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it. Don’t let them pay any attention to lying words.”


## Exodus 5:10 (id: 1802005010)

10The taskmasters of the people went out with their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you straw.


## Exodus 5:11 (id: 1802005011)

11Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’”


## Exodus 5:12 (id: 1802005012)

12So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.


## Exodus 5:13 (id: 1802005013)

13The taskmasters were urgent saying, “Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!”


## Exodus 5:14 (id: 1802005014)

14The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?”


## Exodus 5:15 (id: 1802005015)

15Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?


## Exodus 5:16 (id: 1802005016)

16No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.”


## Exodus 5:17 (id: 1802005017)

17But Pharaoh said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to the LORD.’


## Exodus 5:18 (id: 1802005018)

18Go therefore now, and work; for no straw shall be given to you; yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!”


## Exodus 5:19 (id: 1802005019)

19The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble when it was said, “You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!”


## Exodus 5:20 (id: 1802005020)

20They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along the way, as they came out from Pharaoh.


## Exodus 5:21 (id: 1802005021)

21They said to them, “May the LORD look at you and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!”


## Exodus 5:22 (id: 1802005022)

22Moses returned to the LORD, and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?


## Exodus 5:23 (id: 1802005023)

23For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people. You have not rescued your people at all!”


## Exodus 6:1 (id: 1802006001)

1The LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.”


## Exodus 6:2 (id: 1802006002)

2God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am the LORD.


## Exodus 6:3 (id: 1802006003)

3I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name the LORD I was not known to them.


## Exodus 6:4 (id: 1802006004)

4I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens.


## Exodus 6:5 (id: 1802006005)

5Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.


## Exodus 6:6 (id: 1802006006)

6Therefore tell the children of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments.


## Exodus 6:7 (id: 1802006007)

7I will take you to myself for a people. I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.


## Exodus 6:8 (id: 1802006008)

8I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the LORD.’”


## Exodus 6:9 (id: 1802006009)

9Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn’t listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.


## Exodus 6:10 (id: 1802006010)

10The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,


## Exodus 6:11 (id: 1802006011)

11“Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.”

16but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth,


## Exodus 9:17 (id: 1802009017)

17because you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won’t let them go.

10You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.


## Exodus 15:11 (id: 1802015011)

11Who is like you, LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?


## Exodus 15:12 (id: 1802015012)

12You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.


## Exodus 15:13 (id: 1802015013)

13“You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.


## Exodus 15:14 (id: 1802015014)

14The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.


## Exodus 15:15 (id: 1802015015)

15Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.


## Exodus 15:16 (id: 1802015016)

16Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone, until your people pass over, LORD, until the people you have purchased pass over.


## Exodus 15:17 (id: 1802015017)

17You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, the place, LORD, which you have made for yourself to dwell in: the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established.

20Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.

23When they came to Marah, they couldn’t drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah.

## Exodus 15:26 (id: 1802015026)

26He said, “If you will diligently listen to the LORD your God’s voice, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am the LORD who heals you.”

## Exodus 16:2 (id: 1802016002)

2The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;


## Exodus 16:3 (id: 1802016003)

3and the children of Israel said to them, “We wish that we had died by the LORD’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”


## Exodus 16:4 (id: 1802016004)

4Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.


## Exodus 16:5 (id: 1802016005)

5It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”


## Exodus 16:6 (id: 1802016006)

6Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, “At evening, you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt.


## Exodus 16:7 (id: 1802016007)

7In the morning, you shall see the LORD’s glory; because he hears your murmurings against the LORD. Who are we, that you murmur against us?”


## Exodus 16:8 (id: 1802016008)

8Moses said, “Now the LORD will give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you, because the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.”


## Exodus 16:9 (id: 1802016009)

9Moses said to Aaron, “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come close to the LORD, for he has heard your murmurings.’”


## Exodus 16:10 (id: 1802016010)

10As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the LORD’s glory appeared in the cloud.


## Exodus 16:11 (id: 1802016011)

11The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,


## Exodus 16:12 (id: 1802016012)

12“I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.’”


## Exodus 16:13 (id: 1802016013)

13In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.


## Exodus 16:14 (id: 1802016014)

14When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.


## Exodus 16:15 (id: 1802016015)

15When the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.


## Exodus 16:16 (id: 1802016016)

16This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: ‘Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.’”


## Exodus 16:17 (id: 1802016017)

17The children of Israel did so, and some gathered more, some less.


## Exodus 16:18 (id: 1802016018)

18When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They each gathered according to his eating.


## Exodus 16:19 (id: 1802016019)

19Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.”


## Exodus 16:20 (id: 1802016020)

20Notwithstanding they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them.


## Exodus 16:21 (id: 1802016021)

21They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.


## Exodus 16:22 (id: 1802016022)

22On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.


## Exodus 16:23 (id: 1802016023)

23He said to them, “This is that which the LORD has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’”


## Exodus 16:24 (id: 1802016024)

24They laid it up until the morning, as Moses ordered, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it.


## Exodus 16:25 (id: 1802016025)

25Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you shall not find it in the field.


## Exodus 16:26 (id: 1802016026)

26Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.”


## Exodus 16:27 (id: 1802016027)

27On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.


## Exodus 16:28 (id: 1802016028)

28The LORD said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?


## Exodus 16:29 (id: 1802016029)

29Behold, because the LORD has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”


## Exodus 16:30 (id: 1802016030)

30So the people rested on the seventh day.


## Exodus 16:31 (id: 1802016031)

31The house of Israel called its name “Manna”, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.


## Exodus 16:32 (id: 1802016032)

32Moses said, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, ‘Let an omer\-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”


## Exodus 16:33 (id: 1802016033)

33Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer\-full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept throughout your generations.”


## Exodus 16:34 (id: 1802016034)

34As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.


## Exodus 16:35 (id: 1802016035)

35The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.


## Exodus 16:36 (id: 1802016036)

36Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.


## Exodus 17:1 (id: 1802017001)

1All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, starting according to the LORD’s commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.


## Exodus 17:2 (id: 1802017002)

2Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?”


## Exodus 17:3 (id: 1802017003)

3The people were thirsty for water there; so the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”


## Exodus 17:4 (id: 1802017004)

4Moses cried to the LORD, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”


## Exodus 17:5 (id: 1802017005)

5The LORD said to Moses, “Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.


## Exodus 17:6 (id: 1802017006)

6Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.


## Exodus 17:7 (id: 1802017007)

7He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us, or not?”


## Exodus 17:8 (id: 1802017008)

8Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.


## Exodus 17:9 (id: 1802017009)

9Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God’s rod in my hand.”


## Exodus 17:10 (id: 1802017010)

10So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.


## Exodus 17:11 (id: 1802017011)

11When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. When he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.


## Exodus 17:12 (id: 1802017012)

12But Moses’ hands were heavy; so they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset.


## Exodus 17:13 (id: 1802017013)

13Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.


## Exodus 17:14 (id: 1802017014)

14The LORD said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.”


## Exodus 17:15 (id: 1802017015)

15Moses built an altar, and called its name “The LORD our Banner”.


## Exodus 17:16 (id: 1802017016)

16He said, “The LORD has sworn: ‘The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.’”


## Exodus 18:1 (id: 1802018001)

1Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father\-in\-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.


## Exodus 18:2 (id: 1802018002)

2Jethro, Moses’ father\-in\-law, received Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,


## Exodus 18:3 (id: 1802018003)

3and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land”.


## Exodus 18:4 (id: 1802018004)

4The name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, “My father’s God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword.”


## Exodus 18:5 (id: 1802018005)

5Jethro, Moses’ father\-in\-law, came with Moses’ sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God.


## Exodus 18:6 (id: 1802018006)

6He said to Moses, “I, your father\-in\-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.”


## Exodus 18:7 (id: 1802018007)

7Moses went out to meet his father\-in\-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.


## Exodus 18:8 (id: 1802018008)

8Moses told his father\-in\-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how the LORD delivered them.


## Exodus 18:9 (id: 1802018009)

9Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.


## Exodus 18:10 (id: 1802018010)

10Jethro said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.


## Exodus 18:11 (id: 1802018011)

11Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods because of the way that they treated people arrogantly.”


## Exodus 18:12 (id: 1802018012)

12Jethro, Moses’ father\-in\-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father\-in\-law before God.


## Exodus 18:13 (id: 1802018013)

13On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.


## Exodus 18:14 (id: 1802018014)

14When Moses’ father\-in\-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?”


## Exodus 18:15 (id: 1802018015)

15Moses said to his father\-in\-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.


## Exodus 18:16 (id: 1802018016)

16When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.”


## Exodus 18:17 (id: 1802018017)

17Moses’ father\-in\-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good.


## Exodus 18:18 (id: 1802018018)

18You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.


## Exodus 18:19 (id: 1802018019)

19Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.


## Exodus 18:20 (id: 1802018020)

20You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.


## Exodus 18:21 (id: 1802018021)

21Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.


## Exodus 18:22 (id: 1802018022)

22Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.


## Exodus 18:23 (id: 1802018023)

23If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.”


## Exodus 18:24 (id: 1802018024)

24So Moses listened to the voice of his father\-in\-law, and did all that he had said.


## Exodus 18:25 (id: 1802018025)

25Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.


## Exodus 18:26 (id: 1802018026)

26They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard cases to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.


## Exodus 18:27 (id: 1802018027)

27Moses let his father\-in\-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.


## Exodus 19:1 (id: 1802019001)

1In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.


## Exodus 19:2 (id: 1802019002)

2When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.


## Exodus 19:3 (id: 1802019003)

3Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:


## Exodus 19:4 (id: 1802019004)

4‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself.


## Exodus 19:5 (id: 1802019005)

5Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;


## Exodus 19:6 (id: 1802019006)

6and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”


## Exodus 19:7 (id: 1802019007)

7Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD commanded him.


## Exodus 19:8 (id: 1802019008)

8All the people answered together, and said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do.” Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.


## Exodus 19:9 (id: 1802019009)

9The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.” Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.


## Exodus 19:10 (id: 1802019010)

10The LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,


## Exodus 19:11 (id: 1802019011)

11and be ready for the third day; for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.


## Exodus 19:12 (id: 1802019012)

12You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.


## Exodus 19:13 (id: 1802019013)

13No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.”


## Exodus 19:14 (id: 1802019014)

14Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.


## Exodus 19:15 (id: 1802019015)

15He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.”


## Exodus 19:16 (id: 1802019016)

16On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.


## Exodus 19:17 (id: 1802019017)

17Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.


## Exodus 19:18 (id: 1802019018)

18All of Mount Sinai smoked, because the LORD descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.


## Exodus 19:19 (id: 1802019019)

19When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.


## Exodus 19:20 (id: 1802019020)

20The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. The LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.


## Exodus 19:21 (id: 1802019021)

21The LORD said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.


## Exodus 19:22 (id: 1802019022)

22Let the priests also, who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break out on them.”


## Exodus 19:23 (id: 1802019023)

23Moses said to the LORD, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.’”


## Exodus 19:24 (id: 1802019024)

24The LORD said to him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them.”


## Exodus 19:25 (id: 1802019025)

25So Moses went down to the people, and told them.


## Exodus 20:1 (id: 1802020001)

1God spoke all these words, saying,


## Exodus 20:2 (id: 1802020002)

2“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.


## Exodus 20:3 (id: 1802020003)

3“You shall have no other gods before me.


## Exodus 20:4 (id: 1802020004)

4“You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:


## Exodus 20:5 (id: 1802020005)

5you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,


## Exodus 20:6 (id: 1802020006)

6and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.


## Exodus 20:7 (id: 1802020007)

7“You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who misuses his name.


## Exodus 20:8 (id: 1802020008)

8“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.


## Exodus 20:9 (id: 1802020009)
