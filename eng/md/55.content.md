## 2 Timothy 1:1 (id: 1855001001)

1Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,


## 2 Timothy 1:2 (id: 1855001002)

2to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.


## 2 Timothy 1:3 (id: 1855001003)

3I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day


## 2 Timothy 1:4 (id: 1855001004)

4longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;


## 2 Timothy 1:5 (id: 1855001005)

5having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also.


## 2 Timothy 1:6 (id: 1855001006)

6For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.


## 2 Timothy 1:7 (id: 1855001007)

7For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self\-control.


## 2 Timothy 1:8 (id: 1855001008)

8Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,


## 2 Timothy 1:9 (id: 1855001009)

9who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,


## 2 Timothy 1:10 (id: 1855001010)

10but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.


## 2 Timothy 1:11 (id: 1855001011)

11For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.


## 2 Timothy 1:12 (id: 1855001012)

12For this cause I also suffer these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.


## 2 Timothy 1:13 (id: 1855001013)

13Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.


## 2 Timothy 1:14 (id: 1855001014)

14That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.


## 2 Timothy 1:15 (id: 1855001015)

15This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.


## 2 Timothy 1:16 (id: 1855001016)

16May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,


## 2 Timothy 1:17 (id: 1855001017)

17but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me


## 2 Timothy 1:18 (id: 1855001018)

18(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.


## 2 Timothy 2:1 (id: 1855002001)

1You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.


## 2 Timothy 2:2 (id: 1855002002)

2The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.


## 2 Timothy 2:3 (id: 1855002003)

3You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.


## 2 Timothy 2:4 (id: 1855002004)

4No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.


## 2 Timothy 2:5 (id: 1855002005)

5Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.


## 2 Timothy 2:6 (id: 1855002006)

6The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops.


## 2 Timothy 2:7 (id: 1855002007)

7Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.


## 2 Timothy 2:8 (id: 1855002008)

8Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring of David, according to my Good News,


## 2 Timothy 2:9 (id: 1855002009)

9in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.


## 2 Timothy 2:10 (id: 1855002010)

10Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.


## 2 Timothy 2:11 (id: 1855002011)

11This saying is trustworthy: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him.


## 2 Timothy 2:12 (id: 1855002012)

12If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us.


## 2 Timothy 2:13 (id: 1855002013)

13If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he can’t deny himself.”


## 2 Timothy 2:14 (id: 1855002014)

14Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.


## 2 Timothy 2:15 (id: 1855002015)

15Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.


## 2 Timothy 2:16 (id: 1855002016)

16But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,


## 2 Timothy 2:17 (id: 1855002017)

17and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus:


## 2 Timothy 2:18 (id: 1855002018)

18men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.


## 2 Timothy 2:19 (id: 1855002019)

19However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”


## 2 Timothy 2:20 (id: 1855002020)

20Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for dishonor.


## 2 Timothy 2:21 (id: 1855002021)

21If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.


## 2 Timothy 2:22 (id: 1855002022)

22Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.


## 2 Timothy 2:23 (id: 1855002023)

23But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.


## 2 Timothy 2:24 (id: 1855002024)

24The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient,


## 2 Timothy 2:25 (id: 1855002025)

25in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,


## 2 Timothy 2:26 (id: 1855002026)

26and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will.


## 2 Timothy 3:1 (id: 1855003001)

1But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come.


## 2 Timothy 3:2 (id: 1855003002)

2For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,


## 2 Timothy 3:3 (id: 1855003003)

3without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self\-control, fierce, not lovers of good,


## 2 Timothy 3:4 (id: 1855003004)

4traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,


## 2 Timothy 3:5 (id: 1855003005)

5holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.


## 2 Timothy 3:6 (id: 1855003006)

6For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,


## 2 Timothy 3:7 (id: 1855003007)

7always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.


## 2 Timothy 3:8 (id: 1855003008)

8Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected.


## 2 Timothy 3:9 (id: 1855003009)

9But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.


## 2 Timothy 3:10 (id: 1855003010)

10But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,


## 2 Timothy 3:11 (id: 1855003011)

11persecutions, and sufferings—those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all.


## 2 Timothy 3:12 (id: 1855003012)

12Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.


## 2 Timothy 3:13 (id: 1855003013)

13But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.


## 2 Timothy 3:14 (id: 1855003014)

14But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.


## 2 Timothy 3:15 (id: 1855003015)

15From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.


## 2 Timothy 3:16 (id: 1855003016)

16Every Scripture is God\-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,


## 2 Timothy 3:17 (id: 1855003017)

17that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.


## 2 Timothy 4:1 (id: 1855004001)

1I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:


## 2 Timothy 4:2 (id: 1855004002)

2preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching.


## 2 Timothy 4:3 (id: 1855004003)

3For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts,


## 2 Timothy 4:4 (id: 1855004004)

4and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables.


## 2 Timothy 4:5 (id: 1855004005)

5But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.


## 2 Timothy 4:6 (id: 1855004006)

6For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.


## 2 Timothy 4:7 (id: 1855004007)

7I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.


## 2 Timothy 4:8 (id: 1855004008)

8From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.


## 2 Timothy 4:9 (id: 1855004009)

9Be diligent to come to me soon,


## 2 Timothy 4:10 (id: 1855004010)

10for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia.


## 2 Timothy 4:11 (id: 1855004011)

11Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.


## 2 Timothy 4:12 (id: 1855004012)

12But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.


## 2 Timothy 4:13 (id: 1855004013)

13Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments.


## 2 Timothy 4:14 (id: 1855004014)

14Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.


## 2 Timothy 4:15 (id: 1855004015)

15Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words.


## 2 Timothy 4:16 (id: 1855004016)

16At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.


## 2 Timothy 4:17 (id: 1855004017)

17But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.


## 2 Timothy 4:18 (id: 1855004018)

18And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.


## 2 Timothy 4:19 (id: 1855004019)

19Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.


## 2 Timothy 4:20 (id: 1855004020)

20Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.


## 2 Timothy 4:21 (id: 1855004021)

21Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.


## 2 Timothy 4:22 (id: 1855004022)

22The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
