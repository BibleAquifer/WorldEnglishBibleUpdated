## Psalms 74:1 (id: 1819074001)

1A contemplation by Asaph. God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?


## Psalms 74:2 (id: 1819074002)

2Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance: Mount Zion, in which you have lived.


## Psalms 74:3 (id: 1819074003)

3Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.


## Psalms 74:4 (id: 1819074004)

4Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.


## Psalms 74:5 (id: 1819074005)

5They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a thicket of trees.


## Psalms 74:6 (id: 1819074006)

6Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.


## Psalms 74:7 (id: 1819074007)

7They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.


## Psalms 74:8 (id: 1819074008)

8They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.” They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.


## Psalms 74:9 (id: 1819074009)

9We see no miraculous signs. There is no longer any prophet, neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.


## Psalms 74:10 (id: 1819074010)

10How long, God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?


## Psalms 74:11 (id: 1819074011)

11Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it from your chest and consume them!


## Psalms 74:12 (id: 1819074012)

12Yet God is my King of old, working salvation throughout the earth.


## Psalms 74:13 (id: 1819074013)

13You divided the sea by your strength. You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.


## Psalms 74:14 (id: 1819074014)

14You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.


## Psalms 74:15 (id: 1819074015)

15You opened up spring and stream. You dried up mighty rivers.


## Psalms 74:16 (id: 1819074016)

16The day is yours, the night is also yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.


## Psalms 74:17 (id: 1819074017)

17You have set all the boundaries of the earth. You have made summer and winter.


## Psalms 74:18 (id: 1819074018)

18Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, LORD. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.


## Psalms 74:19 (id: 1819074019)

19Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts. Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.


## Psalms 74:20 (id: 1819074020)

20Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.


## Psalms 74:21 (id: 1819074021)

21Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name.


## Psalms 74:22 (id: 1819074022)

22Arise, God! Plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.


## Psalms 74:23 (id: 1819074023)

23Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.


## Psalms 75:1 (id: 1819075001)

1For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Psalm by Asaph. A song. We give thanks to you, God. We give thanks, for your Name is near. Men tell about your wondrous works.


## Psalms 75:2 (id: 1819075002)

2When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.


## Psalms 75:3 (id: 1819075003)

3The earth and all its inhabitants quake. I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.


## Psalms 75:4 (id: 1819075004)

4I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!” I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.


## Psalms 75:5 (id: 1819075005)

5Don’t lift up your horn on high. Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”


## Psalms 75:6 (id: 1819075006)

6For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.


## Psalms 75:7 (id: 1819075007)

7But God is the judge. He puts down one, and lifts up another.


## Psalms 75:8 (id: 1819075008)

8For in the LORD’s hand there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.


## Psalms 75:9 (id: 1819075009)

9But I will declare this forever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.


## Psalms 75:10 (id: 1819075010)

10I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.


## Psalms 76:1 (id: 1819076001)

1For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph. A song. In Judah, God is known. His name is great in Israel.


## Psalms 76:2 (id: 1819076002)

2His tabernacle is also in Salem. His dwelling place in Zion.


## Psalms 76:3 (id: 1819076003)

3There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.


## Psalms 76:4 (id: 1819076004)

4Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.


## Psalms 76:5 (id: 1819076005)

5Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands.


## Psalms 76:6 (id: 1819076006)

6At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.


## Psalms 76:7 (id: 1819076007)

7You, even you, are to be feared. Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?


## Psalms 76:8 (id: 1819076008)

8You pronounced judgment from heaven. The earth feared, and was silent,


## Psalms 76:9 (id: 1819076009)

9when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah.


## Psalms 76:10 (id: 1819076010)

10Surely the wrath of man praises you. The survivors of your wrath are restrained.


## Psalms 76:11 (id: 1819076011)

11Make vows to the LORD your God, and fulfill them! Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.


## Psalms 76:12 (id: 1819076012)

12He will cut off the spirit of princes. He is feared by the kings of the earth.


## Psalms 77:1 (id: 1819077001)

1For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by Asaph. My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him to listen to me.


## Psalms 77:2 (id: 1819077002)

2In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.


## Psalms 77:3 (id: 1819077003)

3I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.


## Psalms 77:4 (id: 1819077004)

4You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can’t speak.


## Psalms 77:5 (id: 1819077005)

5I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.


## Psalms 77:6 (id: 1819077006)

6I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:


## Psalms 77:7 (id: 1819077007)

7“Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?


## Psalms 77:8 (id: 1819077008)

8Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?


## Psalms 77:9 (id: 1819077009)

9Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?” Selah.


## Psalms 77:10 (id: 1819077010)

10Then I thought, “I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of the Most High.”


## Psalms 77:11 (id: 1819077011)

11I will remember the LORD’s deeds; for I will remember your wonders of old.


## Psalms 77:12 (id: 1819077012)

12I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.


## Psalms 77:13 (id: 1819077013)

13Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God?


## Psalms 77:14 (id: 1819077014)

14You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.


## Psalms 77:15 (id: 1819077015)

15You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.


## Psalms 77:16 (id: 1819077016)

16The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.


## Psalms 77:17 (id: 1819077017)

17The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.


## Psalms 77:18 (id: 1819077018)

18The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.


## Psalms 77:19 (id: 1819077019)

19Your way was through the sea, your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.


## Psalms 77:20 (id: 1819077020)

20You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.


## Psalms 78:1 (id: 1819078001)

1A contemplation by Asaph. Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.


## Psalms 78:2 (id: 1819078002)

2I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,


## Psalms 78:3 (id: 1819078003)

3which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.


## Psalms 78:4 (id: 1819078004)

4We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.


## Psalms 78:5 (id: 1819078005)

5For he established a covenant in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;


## Psalms 78:6 (id: 1819078006)

6that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,


## Psalms 78:7 (id: 1819078007)

7that they might set their hope in God, and not forget God’s deeds, but keep his commandments,


## Psalms 78:8 (id: 1819078008)

8and might not be as their fathers— a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.


## Psalms 78:9 (id: 1819078009)

9The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.


## Psalms 78:10 (id: 1819078010)

10They didn’t keep God’s covenant, and refused to walk in his law.


## Psalms 78:11 (id: 1819078011)

11They forgot his doings, his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.


## Psalms 78:12 (id: 1819078012)

12He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.


## Psalms 78:13 (id: 1819078013)

13He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.


## Psalms 78:14 (id: 1819078014)

14In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.


## Psalms 78:15 (id: 1819078015)

15He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.


## Psalms 78:16 (id: 1819078016)

16He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.


## Psalms 78:17 (id: 1819078017)

17Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.


## Psalms 78:18 (id: 1819078018)

18They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.


## Psalms 78:19 (id: 1819078019)

19Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?


## Psalms 78:20 (id: 1819078020)

20Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?”


## Psalms 78:21 (id: 1819078021)

21Therefore the LORD heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,


## Psalms 78:22 (id: 1819078022)

22because they didn’t believe in God, and didn’t trust in his salvation.


## Psalms 78:23 (id: 1819078023)

23Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.


## Psalms 78:24 (id: 1819078024)

24He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.


## Psalms 78:25 (id: 1819078025)

25Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.


## Psalms 78:26 (id: 1819078026)

26He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.


## Psalms 78:27 (id: 1819078027)

27He also rained meat on them as the dust, winged birds as the sand of the seas.


## Psalms 78:28 (id: 1819078028)

28He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations.


## Psalms 78:29 (id: 1819078029)

29So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.


## Psalms 78:30 (id: 1819078030)

30They didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,


## Psalms 78:31 (id: 1819078031)

31when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of their strongest, and struck down the young men of Israel.


## Psalms 78:32 (id: 1819078032)

32For all this they still sinned, and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.


## Psalms 78:33 (id: 1819078033)

33Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.


## Psalms 78:34 (id: 1819078034)

34When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.


## Psalms 78:35 (id: 1819078035)

35They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.


## Psalms 78:36 (id: 1819078036)

36But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.


## Psalms 78:37 (id: 1819078037)

37For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.


## Psalms 78:38 (id: 1819078038)

38But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn’t stir up all his wrath.


## Psalms 78:39 (id: 1819078039)

39He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.


## Psalms 78:40 (id: 1819078040)

40How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!


## Psalms 78:41 (id: 1819078041)

41They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.


## Psalms 78:42 (id: 1819078042)

42They didn’t remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;


## Psalms 78:43 (id: 1819078043)

43how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,


## Psalms 78:44 (id: 1819078044)

44he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.


## Psalms 78:45 (id: 1819078045)

45He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.


## Psalms 78:46 (id: 1819078046)

46He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.


## Psalms 78:47 (id: 1819078047)

47He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.


## Psalms 78:48 (id: 1819078048)

48He also gave over their livestock to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.


## Psalms 78:49 (id: 1819078049)

49He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.


## Psalms 78:50 (id: 1819078050)

50He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,


## Psalms 78:51 (id: 1819078051)

51and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.


## Psalms 78:52 (id: 1819078052)

52But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.


## Psalms 78:53 (id: 1819078053)

53He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.


## Psalms 78:54 (id: 1819078054)

54He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.


## Psalms 78:55 (id: 1819078055)

55He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.


## Psalms 78:56 (id: 1819078056)

56Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t keep his testimonies,


## Psalms 78:57 (id: 1819078057)

57but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a deceitful bow.


## Psalms 78:58 (id: 1819078058)

58For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.


## Psalms 78:59 (id: 1819078059)

59When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel,


## Psalms 78:60 (id: 1819078060)

60so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men,


## Psalms 78:61 (id: 1819078061)

61and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary’s hand.


## Psalms 78:62 (id: 1819078062)

62He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.


## Psalms 78:63 (id: 1819078063)

63Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.


## Psalms 78:64 (id: 1819078064)

64Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn’t weep.


## Psalms 78:65 (id: 1819078065)

65Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.


## Psalms 78:66 (id: 1819078066)

66He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.


## Psalms 78:67 (id: 1819078067)

67Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,


## Psalms 78:68 (id: 1819078068)

68But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.


## Psalms 78:69 (id: 1819078069)

69He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.


## Psalms 78:70 (id: 1819078070)

70He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;


## Psalms 78:71 (id: 1819078071)

71from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.


## Psalms 78:72 (id: 1819078072)

72So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.


## Psalms 79:1 (id: 1819079001)

1A Psalm by Asaph. God, the nations have come into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.


## Psalms 79:2 (id: 1819079002)

2They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.


## Psalms 79:3 (id: 1819079003)

3They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.


## Psalms 79:4 (id: 1819079004)

4We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.


## Psalms 79:5 (id: 1819079005)

5How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?


## Psalms 79:6 (id: 1819079006)

6Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,


## Psalms 79:7 (id: 1819079007)

7for they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.


## Psalms 79:8 (id: 1819079008)

8Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.


## Psalms 79:9 (id: 1819079009)

9Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.


## Psalms 79:10 (id: 1819079010)

10Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.


## Psalms 79:11 (id: 1819079011)

11Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.


## Psalms 79:12 (id: 1819079012)

12Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.


## Psalms 79:13 (id: 1819079013)

13So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will praise you forever, to all generations.


## Psalms 80:1 (id: 1819080001)

1For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm by Asaph. Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.


## Psalms 80:2 (id: 1819080002)

2Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your might! Come to save us!


## Psalms 80:3 (id: 1819080003)

3Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.


## Psalms 80:4 (id: 1819080004)

4LORD God of Armies, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?


## Psalms 80:5 (id: 1819080005)

5You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.


## Psalms 80:6 (id: 1819080006)

6You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.


## Psalms 80:7 (id: 1819080007)

7Turn us again, God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.


## Psalms 80:8 (id: 1819080008)

8You brought a vine out of Egypt. You drove out the nations, and planted it.


## Psalms 80:9 (id: 1819080009)

9You cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land.


## Psalms 80:10 (id: 1819080010)

10The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God’s cedars.


## Psalms 80:11 (id: 1819080011)

11It sent out its branches to the sea, its shoots to the River.


## Psalms 80:12 (id: 1819080012)

19for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven, the LORD saw the earth,


## Psalms 102:20 (id: 1819102020)

20to hear the groans of the prisoner, to free those who are condemned to death,


## Psalms 102:21 (id: 1819102021)

21that men may declare the LORD’s name in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem,


## Psalms 102:22 (id: 1819102022)

22when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.


## Psalms 102:23 (id: 1819102023)

23He weakened my strength along the course. He shortened my days.


## Psalms 102:24 (id: 1819102024)

24I said, “My God, don’t take me away in the middle of my days. Your years are throughout all generations.


## Psalms 102:25 (id: 1819102025)

25Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the work of your hands.


## Psalms 102:26 (id: 1819102026)

26They will perish, but you will endure. Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.


## Psalms 102:27 (id: 1819102027)

27But you are the same. Your years will have no end.


## Psalms 102:28 (id: 1819102028)

28The children of your servants will continue. Their offspring will be established before you.”


## Psalms 103:1 (id: 1819103001)

7He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel.


## Psalms 103:8 (id: 1819103008)

8The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.


## Psalms 103:9 (id: 1819103009)

9He will not always accuse; neither will he stay angry forever.


## Psalms 103:10 (id: 1819103010)

10He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us for our iniquities.


## Psalms 103:11 (id: 1819103011)

11For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.


## Psalms 103:12 (id: 1819103012)

12As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.


## Psalms 103:13 (id: 1819103013)

13Like a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.


## Psalms 103:14 (id: 1819103014)

14For he knows how we are made. He remembers that we are dust.


## Psalms 103:15 (id: 1819103015)

15As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.


## Psalms 103:16 (id: 1819103016)

16For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more.


## Psalms 103:17 (id: 1819103017)

17But the LORD’s loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him, his righteousness to children’s children,


## Psalms 103:18 (id: 1819103018)

18to those who keep his covenant, to those who remember to obey his precepts.

1Bless the LORD, my soul. The LORD, my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty.


## Psalms 104:2 (id: 1819104002)

2He covers himself with light as with a garment. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.


## Psalms 104:3 (id: 1819104003)

3He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters. He makes the clouds his chariot. He walks on the wings of the wind.

4He makes his messengers winds, and his servants flames of fire.


## Psalms 104:5 (id: 1819104005)

5He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever.


## Psalms 104:6 (id: 1819104006)

6You covered it with the deep as with a cloak. The waters stood above the mountains.


## Psalms 104:7 (id: 1819104007)

7At your rebuke they fled. At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.


## Psalms 104:8 (id: 1819104008)

8The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which you had assigned to them.


## Psalms 104:9 (id: 1819104009)

9You have set a boundary that they may not pass over, that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.


## Psalms 104:10 (id: 1819104010)

10He sends springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains.


## Psalms 104:11 (id: 1819104011)

11They give drink to every animal of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.


## Psalms 104:12 (id: 1819104012)

12The birds of the sky nest by them. They sing among the branches.


## Psalms 104:13 (id: 1819104013)

13He waters the mountains from his rooms. The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.


## Psalms 104:14 (id: 1819104014)

14He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may produce food out of the earth:


## Psalms 104:15 (id: 1819104015)

15wine that makes the heart of man glad, oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man’s heart.


## Psalms 104:16 (id: 1819104016)

16The LORD’s trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted,


## Psalms 104:17 (id: 1819104017)

17where the birds make their nests. The stork makes its home in the cypress trees.


## Psalms 104:18 (id: 1819104018)

18The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.


## Psalms 104:19 (id: 1819104019)

19He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows when to set.


## Psalms 104:20 (id: 1819104020)

20You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals of the forest prowl.


## Psalms 104:21 (id: 1819104021)

21The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.


## Psalms 104:22 (id: 1819104022)

22The sun rises, and they steal away, and lie down in their dens.


## Psalms 104:23 (id: 1819104023)

23Man goes out to his work, to his labor until the evening.

24LORD, how many are your works! In wisdom, you have made them all. The earth is full of your riches.

25There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable living things, both small and large animals.


## Psalms 104:26 (id: 1819104026)

26There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.


## Psalms 104:27 (id: 1819104027)

27These all wait for you, that you may give them their food in due season.


## Psalms 104:28 (id: 1819104028)

28You give to them; they gather. You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.


## Psalms 104:29 (id: 1819104029)

29You hide your face; they are troubled. You take away their breath; they die and return to the dust.


## Psalms 104:30 (id: 1819104030)

30You send out your Spirit and they are created. You renew the face of the ground.


## Psalms 104:31 (id: 1819104031)

31Let the LORD’s glory endure forever. Let the LORD rejoice in his works.


## Psalms 104:32 (id: 1819104032)

32He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.


## Psalms 104:33 (id: 1819104033)

33I will sing to the LORD as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.


## Psalms 104:34 (id: 1819104034)

34Let my meditation be sweet to him. I will rejoice in the LORD.


## Psalms 104:35 (id: 1819104035)

1Give thanks to the LORD! Call on his name! Make his doings known among the peoples.

6you offspring of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

7He is the LORD, our God. His judgments are in all the earth.

8He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,


## Psalms 105:9 (id: 1819105009)

9the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac,


## Psalms 105:10 (id: 1819105010)

10and confirmed it to Jacob for a statute; to Israel for an everlasting covenant,


## Psalms 105:11 (id: 1819105011)

11saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,”


## Psalms 105:12 (id: 1819105012)

12when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners in it.


## Psalms 105:13 (id: 1819105013)

13They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.


## Psalms 105:14 (id: 1819105014)

14He allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,


## Psalms 105:15 (id: 1819105015)

15“Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!”


## Psalms 105:16 (id: 1819105016)

16He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.


## Psalms 105:17 (id: 1819105017)

17He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a slave.


## Psalms 105:18 (id: 1819105018)

18They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons,


## Psalms 105:19 (id: 1819105019)

19until the time that his word happened, and the LORD’s word proved him true.


## Psalms 105:20 (id: 1819105020)

20The king sent and freed him, even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.


## Psalms 105:21 (id: 1819105021)

21He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions,


## Psalms 105:22 (id: 1819105022)

22to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.


## Psalms 105:23 (id: 1819105023)

23Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob lived in the land of Ham.


## Psalms 105:24 (id: 1819105024)

24He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.


## Psalms 105:25 (id: 1819105025)

25He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.


## Psalms 105:26 (id: 1819105026)

26He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.


## Psalms 105:27 (id: 1819105027)

27They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.


## Psalms 105:28 (id: 1819105028)

28He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn’t rebel against his words.

29He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.


## Psalms 105:30 (id: 1819105030)

30Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the rooms of their kings.


## Psalms 105:31 (id: 1819105031)

31He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.


## Psalms 105:32 (id: 1819105032)

32He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.


## Psalms 105:33 (id: 1819105033)

33He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.


## Psalms 105:34 (id: 1819105034)

34He spoke, and the locusts came with the grasshoppers, without number.


## Psalms 105:35 (id: 1819105035)

35They ate up every plant in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.


## Psalms 105:36 (id: 1819105036)

36He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their manhood.


## Psalms 105:37 (id: 1819105037)

37He brought them out with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among his tribes.


## Psalms 105:38 (id: 1819105038)

38Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them.


## Psalms 105:39 (id: 1819105039)

39He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.


## Psalms 105:40 (id: 1819105040)

40They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.


## Psalms 105:41 (id: 1819105041)

41He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places.


## Psalms 105:42 (id: 1819105042)

42For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.


## Psalms 105:43 (id: 1819105043)

43He brought his people out with joy, his chosen with singing.


## Psalms 105:44 (id: 1819105044)

44He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,


## Psalms 105:45 (id: 1819105045)

45that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!


## Psalms 106:1 (id: 1819106001)

1Praise the LORD! Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.


## Psalms 106:2 (id: 1819106002)

2Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD, or fully declare all his praise?


## Psalms 106:3 (id: 1819106003)

3Blessed are those who keep justice. Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.


## Psalms 106:4 (id: 1819106004)

4Remember me, LORD, with the favor that you show to your people. Visit me with your salvation,


## Psalms 106:5 (id: 1819106005)

5that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.


## Psalms 106:6 (id: 1819106006)

6We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.


## Psalms 106:7 (id: 1819106007)

7Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.


## Psalms 106:8 (id: 1819106008)

8Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power known.


## Psalms 106:9 (id: 1819106009)

9He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.


## Psalms 106:10 (id: 1819106010)

10He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.


## Psalms 106:11 (id: 1819106011)

11The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.


## Psalms 106:12 (id: 1819106012)

12Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.


## Psalms 106:13 (id: 1819106013)

13They soon forgot his works. They didn’t wait for his counsel,


## Psalms 106:14 (id: 1819106014)

14but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland.


## Psalms 106:15 (id: 1819106015)

15He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.


## Psalms 106:16 (id: 1819106016)

16They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, the LORD’s saint.


## Psalms 106:17 (id: 1819106017)

17The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.


## Psalms 106:18 (id: 1819106018)

18A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.


## Psalms 106:19 (id: 1819106019)

19They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.


## Psalms 106:20 (id: 1819106020)

20Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.


## Psalms 106:21 (id: 1819106021)

21They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,


## Psalms 106:22 (id: 1819106022)

22wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea.


## Psalms 106:23 (id: 1819106023)

23Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.


## Psalms 106:24 (id: 1819106024)

24Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn’t believe his word,


## Psalms 106:25 (id: 1819106025)

25but murmured in their tents, and didn’t listen to the LORD’s voice.


## Psalms 106:26 (id: 1819106026)

26Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,


## Psalms 106:27 (id: 1819106027)

27that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.


## Psalms 106:28 (id: 1819106028)

28They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.


## Psalms 106:29 (id: 1819106029)

29Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.


## Psalms 106:30 (id: 1819106030)

30Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.


## Psalms 106:31 (id: 1819106031)

31That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.


## Psalms 106:32 (id: 1819106032)

32They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;


## Psalms 106:33 (id: 1819106033)

33because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.


## Psalms 106:34 (id: 1819106034)

34They didn’t destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them,


## Psalms 106:35 (id: 1819106035)

35but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.


## Psalms 106:36 (id: 1819106036)

36They served their idols, which became a snare to them.


## Psalms 106:37 (id: 1819106037)

37Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.


## Psalms 106:38 (id: 1819106038)

38They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.


## Psalms 106:39 (id: 1819106039)

39Thus they were defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.


## Psalms 106:40 (id: 1819106040)

40Therefore the LORD burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.


## Psalms 106:41 (id: 1819106041)

41He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.


## Psalms 106:42 (id: 1819106042)

42Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.


## Psalms 106:43 (id: 1819106043)

43He rescued them many times, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.


## Psalms 106:44 (id: 1819106044)

44Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.


## Psalms 106:45 (id: 1819106045)

45He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.


## Psalms 106:46 (id: 1819106046)

46He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.


## Psalms 106:47 (id: 1819106047)

47Save us, LORD, our God, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!


## Psalms 106:48 (id: 1819106048)

48Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, “Amen.” Praise the LORD!


## Psalms 107:1 (id: 1819107001)

1Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.


## Psalms 107:2 (id: 1819107002)

2Let the redeemed by the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,


## Psalms 107:3 (id: 1819107003)

3and gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.


## Psalms 107:4 (id: 1819107004)

4They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.


## Psalms 107:5 (id: 1819107005)

5Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.


## Psalms 107:6 (id: 1819107006)

6Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.


## Psalms 107:7 (id: 1819107007)
