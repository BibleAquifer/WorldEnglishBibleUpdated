## Ezekiel 1:3 (id: 1826001003)

3the LORD’s word came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the LORD’s hand was there on him.


## Ezekiel 1:4 (id: 1826001004)

4I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness around it, and out of the middle of it as it were glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire.


## Ezekiel 1:5 (id: 1826001005)

5Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man.


## Ezekiel 1:6 (id: 1826001006)

6Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.


## Ezekiel 1:7 (id: 1826001007)

7Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.


## Ezekiel 1:8 (id: 1826001008)

8They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had their faces and their wings like this:


## Ezekiel 1:9 (id: 1826001009)

9Their wings were joined to one another. They didn’t turn when they went. Each one went straight forward.


## Ezekiel 1:10 (id: 1826001010)

10As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. The four of them had the face of a lion on the right side. The four of them had the face of an ox on the left side. The four of them also had the face of an eagle.


## Ezekiel 1:11 (id: 1826001011)

11Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their bodies.


## Ezekiel 1:12 (id: 1826001012)

12Each one went straight forward. Where the spirit was to go, they went. They didn’t turn when they went.


## Ezekiel 1:13 (id: 1826001013)

13As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. The fire went up and down among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning went out of the fire.


## Ezekiel 1:14 (id: 1826001014)

14The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.


## Ezekiel 1:15 (id: 1826001015)

15Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.


## Ezekiel 1:16 (id: 1826001016)

16The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. The four of them had one likeness. Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.


## Ezekiel 1:17 (id: 1826001017)

17When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn when they went.

## Ezekiel 1:19 (id: 1826001019)

19When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.


## Ezekiel 1:20 (id: 1826001020)

20Wherever the spirit was to go, they went. The spirit was to go there. The wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.


## Ezekiel 1:21 (id: 1826001021)

21When those went, these went. When those stood, these stood. When those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.


## Ezekiel 1:22 (id: 1826001022)

22Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like an awesome crystal to look at, stretched out over their heads above.


## Ezekiel 1:23 (id: 1826001023)

23Under the expanse, their wings were straight, one toward the other. Each one had two which covered on this side, and each one had two which covered their bodies on that side.


## Ezekiel 1:24 (id: 1826001024)

24When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings.


## Ezekiel 1:25 (id: 1826001025)

25There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.


## Ezekiel 1:26 (id: 1826001026)

26Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. On the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.


## Ezekiel 1:27 (id: 1826001027)

27I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him.


## Ezekiel 1:28 (id: 1826001028)

28As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the LORD’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.


## Ezekiel 2:1 (id: 1826002001)

1He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”


## Ezekiel 2:2 (id: 1826002002)

2The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.


## Ezekiel 2:3 (id: 1826002003)

3He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.


## Ezekiel 2:4 (id: 1826002004)

4The children are impudent and stiff\-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’


## Ezekiel 2:5 (id: 1826002005)

5They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse—for they are a rebellious house—yet they will know that there has been a prophet among them.


## Ezekiel 2:6 (id: 1826002006)

6You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.


## Ezekiel 2:7 (id: 1826002007)

7You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will refuse; for they are most rebellious.


## Ezekiel 2:8 (id: 1826002008)

8But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.”


## Ezekiel 2:9 (id: 1826002009)

9When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it.


## Ezekiel 2:10 (id: 1826002010)

10He spread it before me. It was written within and without; and lamentations, mourning, and woe were written in it.


## Ezekiel 3:1 (id: 1826003001)

1He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”


## Ezekiel 3:2 (id: 1826003002)

2So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll.


## Ezekiel 3:3 (id: 1826003003)

3He said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll that I give you and fill your belly and your bowels with it.” Then I ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth.


## Ezekiel 3:4 (id: 1826003004)

4He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.


## Ezekiel 3:5 (id: 1826003005)

5For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel—


## Ezekiel 3:6 (id: 1826003006)

6not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can’t understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.


## Ezekiel 3:7 (id: 1826003007)

7But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to me; for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard\-hearted.


## Ezekiel 3:8 (id: 1826003008)

8Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.


## Ezekiel 3:9 (id: 1826003009)

9I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.”


## Ezekiel 3:10 (id: 1826003010)

10Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you.


## Ezekiel 3:11 (id: 1826003011)

11Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’ whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse.”


## Ezekiel 3:12 (id: 1826003012)

12Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, “Blessed be the LORD’s glory from his place.”


## Ezekiel 3:13 (id: 1826003013)

13I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.


## Ezekiel 3:14 (id: 1826003014)

14So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the LORD’s hand was strong on me.


## Ezekiel 3:15 (id: 1826003015)

15Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv who lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.


## Ezekiel 3:16 (id: 1826003016)

16At the end of seven days, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 3:17 (id: 1826003017)

17“Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me.


## Ezekiel 3:18 (id: 1826003018)

18When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked man will die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.


## Ezekiel 3:19 (id: 1826003019)

19Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.”


## Ezekiel 3:20 (id: 1826003020)

20“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but I will require his blood at your hand.


## Ezekiel 3:21 (id: 1826003021)

21Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.”


## Ezekiel 3:22 (id: 1826003022)

22The LORD’s hand was there on me; and he said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.”


## Ezekiel 3:23 (id: 1826003023)

23Then I arose, and went out into the plain, and behold, the LORD’s glory stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. Then I fell on my face.


## Ezekiel 3:24 (id: 1826003024)

24Then the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.


## Ezekiel 3:25 (id: 1826003025)

25But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them.


## Ezekiel 3:26 (id: 1826003026)

26I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and will not be able to correct them, for they are a rebellious house.


## Ezekiel 3:27 (id: 1826003027)

27But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.”


## Ezekiel 4:1 (id: 1826004001)

1“You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem.


## Ezekiel 4:2 (id: 1826004002)

2Lay siege against it, build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it and plant battering rams against it all around.


## Ezekiel 4:3 (id: 1826004003)

3Take for yourself an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city. Then set your face toward it. It will be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 4:4 (id: 1826004004)

4“Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. According to the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.


## Ezekiel 4:5 (id: 1826004005)

5For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 4:6 (id: 1826004006)

6“Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have appointed forty days, each day for a year, to you.


## Ezekiel 4:7 (id: 1826004007)

7You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.


## Ezekiel 4:8 (id: 1826004008)

8Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.


## Ezekiel 4:9 (id: 1826004009)

9“Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel. Make bread of it. According to the number of the days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it.


## Ezekiel 4:10 (id: 1826004010)

10Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day. From time to time you shall eat it.


## Ezekiel 4:11 (id: 1826004011)

11You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. From time to time you shall drink.


## Ezekiel 4:12 (id: 1826004012)

12You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.”


## Ezekiel 4:13 (id: 1826004013)

13The LORD said, “Even thus will the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.”


## Ezekiel 4:14 (id: 1826004014)

14Then I said, “Ah Lord GOD! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals. No abominable meat has come into my mouth!”


## Ezekiel 4:15 (id: 1826004015)

15Then he said to me, “Behold, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.”


## Ezekiel 4:16 (id: 1826004016)

16Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness. They will drink water by measure, and in dismay;


## Ezekiel 4:17 (id: 1826004017)

17that they may lack bread and water, be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.


## Ezekiel 5:1 (id: 1826005001)

1“You, son of man, take a sharp sword. You shall take it as a barber’s razor to yourself, and shall cause it to pass over your head and over your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair.


## Ezekiel 5:2 (id: 1826005002)

2A third part you shall burn in the fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled. You shall take a third part, and strike with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.


## Ezekiel 5:3 (id: 1826005003)

3You shall take a small number of these and bind them in the folds of your robe.


## Ezekiel 5:4 (id: 1826005004)

4Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From it a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 5:5 (id: 1826005005)

5“The Lord GOD says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, and countries are around her.


## Ezekiel 5:6 (id: 1826005006)

6She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.’


## Ezekiel 5:7 (id: 1826005007)

7“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have followed the ordinances of the nations that are around you;


## Ezekiel 5:8 (id: 1826005008)

8therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.


## Ezekiel 5:9 (id: 1826005009)

9I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do anything like it any more, because of all your abominations.


## Ezekiel 5:10 (id: 1826005010)

10Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you; and I will scatter the whole remnant of you to all the winds.


## Ezekiel 5:11 (id: 1826005011)

11Therefore as I live,’ says the Lord GOD, ‘surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you. My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity.


## Ezekiel 5:12 (id: 1826005012)

12A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and they will be consumed with famine within you. A third part will fall by the sword around you. A third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.


## Ezekiel 5:13 (id: 1826005013)

13“‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted. They will know that I, the LORD, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.


## Ezekiel 5:14 (id: 1826005014)

14“‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by.


## Ezekiel 5:15 (id: 1826005015)

15So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes—I, the LORD, have spoken it—


## Ezekiel 5:16 (id: 1826005016)

16when I send on them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. I will increase the famine on you and will break your staff of bread.


## Ezekiel 5:17 (id: 1826005017)

17I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood will pass through you. I will bring the sword on you. I, the LORD, have spoken it.’”


## Ezekiel 6:1 (id: 1826006001)

1The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 6:2 (id: 1826006002)

2“Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,


## Ezekiel 6:3 (id: 1826006003)

3and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! The Lord GOD says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.


## Ezekiel 6:4 (id: 1826006004)

4Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your idols.


## Ezekiel 6:5 (id: 1826006005)

5I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars.


## Ezekiel 6:6 (id: 1826006006)

6In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.


## Ezekiel 6:7 (id: 1826006007)

7The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.


## Ezekiel 6:8 (id: 1826006008)

8“‘“Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries.


## Ezekiel 6:9 (id: 1826006009)

9Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.


## Ezekiel 6:10 (id: 1826006010)

10They will know that I am the LORD. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.”’


## Ezekiel 6:11 (id: 1826006011)

11“The Lord GOD says: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas!”, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.


## Ezekiel 6:12 (id: 1826006012)

12He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them.


## Ezekiel 6:13 (id: 1826006013)

13You will know that I am the LORD when their slain men are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every thick oak—the places where they offered pleasant aroma to all their idols.


## Ezekiel 6:14 (id: 1826006014)

14I will stretch out my hand on them and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”


## Ezekiel 7:1 (id: 1826007001)

1Moreover the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 7:2 (id: 1826007002)

2“You, son of man, the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land.


## Ezekiel 7:3 (id: 1826007003)

3Now the end is on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations.


## Ezekiel 7:4 (id: 1826007004)

4My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’


## Ezekiel 7:5 (id: 1826007005)

5“The Lord GOD says: ‘A disaster! A unique disaster! Behold, it comes.


## Ezekiel 7:6 (id: 1826007006)

6An end has come. The end has come! It awakes against you. Behold, it comes.


## Ezekiel 7:7 (id: 1826007007)

7Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come! The day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, on the mountains.


## Ezekiel 7:8 (id: 1826007008)

8Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations.


## Ezekiel 7:9 (id: 1826007009)

9My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways. Your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I, the LORD, strike.


## Ezekiel 7:10 (id: 1826007010)

10“‘Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed. Pride has budded.


## Ezekiel 7:11 (id: 1826007011)

11Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. There will be nothing of value among them.


## Ezekiel 7:12 (id: 1826007012)

12The time has come! The day draws near. Don’t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude.


## Ezekiel 7:13 (id: 1826007013)

13For the seller won’t return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision concerns the whole multitude of it. None will return. None will strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.


## Ezekiel 7:14 (id: 1826007014)

14They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes to the battle, for my wrath is on all its multitude.


## Ezekiel 7:15 (id: 1826007015)

16But of those who escape, they will escape and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity.

17All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water.

18They will also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them. Shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.


## Ezekiel 7:19 (id: 1826007019)

19They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold won’t be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD’s wrath. They won’t satisfy their souls or fill their bellies; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.


## Ezekiel 7:20 (id: 1826007020)

20As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein. Therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing.


## Ezekiel 7:21 (id: 1826007021)

21I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they will profane it.


## Ezekiel 7:22 (id: 1826007022)

22I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret place. Robbers will enter into it, and profane it.


## Ezekiel 7:23 (id: 1826007023)

23“‘Make chains, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.


## Ezekiel 7:24 (id: 1826007024)

25Destruction comes! They will seek peace, and there will be none.


## Ezekiel 7:26 (id: 1826007026)

26Mischief will come on mischief, and rumor will be on rumor. They will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.


## Ezekiel 7:27 (id: 1826007027)

27The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation. The hands of the people of the land will be troubled. I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”


## Ezekiel 8:1 (id: 1826008001)

1In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, the Lord GOD’s hand fell on me there.


## Ezekiel 8:2 (id: 1826008002)

2Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire—from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire, and from his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.


## Ezekiel 8:3 (id: 1826008003)

3He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north, where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.


## Ezekiel 8:4 (id: 1826008004)

4Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.


## Ezekiel 8:5 (id: 1826008005)

5Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and saw, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.


## Ezekiel 8:6 (id: 1826008006)

6He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great abominations.”


## Ezekiel 8:7 (id: 1826008007)

7He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.


## Ezekiel 8:8 (id: 1826008008)

8Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.” When I had dug in the wall, I saw a door.


## Ezekiel 8:9 (id: 1826008009)

9He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.”


## Ezekiel 8:10 (id: 1826008010)

10So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall.


## Ezekiel 8:11 (id: 1826008011)

11Seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel stood before them. In the middle of them Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan stood, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of the cloud of incense went up.


## Ezekiel 8:12 (id: 1826008012)

12Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? For they say, ‘The LORD doesn’t see us. The LORD has forsaken the land.’”


## Ezekiel 8:13 (id: 1826008013)

13He said also to me, “You will again see more of the great abominations which they do.”


## Ezekiel 8:14 (id: 1826008014)

14Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’s house which was toward the north; and I saw the women sit there weeping for Tammuz.


## Ezekiel 8:15 (id: 1826008015)

15Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see yet greater abominations than these.”


## Ezekiel 8:16 (id: 1826008016)

16He brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house; and I saw at the door of the LORD’s temple, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty\-five men with their backs toward the LORD’s temple and their faces toward the east. They were worshiping the sun toward the east.


## Ezekiel 8:17 (id: 1826008017)

17Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger. Behold, they put the branch to their nose.


## Ezekiel 8:18 (id: 1826008018)

18Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.”


## Ezekiel 9:1 (id: 1826009001)

1Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his hand.”


## Ezekiel 9:2 (id: 1826009002)

2Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand. One man in the middle of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.


## Ezekiel 9:3 (id: 1826009003)

3The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.


## Ezekiel 9:4 (id: 1826009004)

4The LORD said to him, “Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done within it.”


## Ezekiel 9:5 (id: 1826009005)

5To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither have pity.


## Ezekiel 9:6 (id: 1826009006)

6Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and women; but don’t come near any man on whom is the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” Then they began at the old men who were before the house.


## Ezekiel 9:7 (id: 1826009007)

7He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” They went out, and struck in the city.


## Ezekiel 9:8 (id: 1826009008)

8While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and said, “Ah Lord GOD! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?”


## Ezekiel 9:9 (id: 1826009009)

9Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion; for they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD doesn’t see.’


## Ezekiel 9:10 (id: 1826009010)

10As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.”


## Ezekiel 9:11 (id: 1826009011)

11Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as you have commanded me.”


## Ezekiel 10:1 (id: 1826010001)

1Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.


## Ezekiel 10:2 (id: 1826010002)

2He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” He went in as I watched.


## Ezekiel 10:3 (id: 1826010003)

3Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.


## Ezekiel 10:4 (id: 1826010004)

4The LORD’s glory mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory.


## Ezekiel 10:5 (id: 1826010005)

5The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.


## Ezekiel 10:6 (id: 1826010006)

6It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” that he went in and stood beside a wheel.


## Ezekiel 10:7 (id: 1826010007)

7The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.


## Ezekiel 10:8 (id: 1826010008)

8The form of a man’s hand appeared here in the cherubim under their wings.


## Ezekiel 10:9 (id: 1826010009)

9I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.


## Ezekiel 10:10 (id: 1826010010)

10As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel.


## Ezekiel 10:11 (id: 1826010011)

11When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They didn’t turn as they went.


## Ezekiel 10:12 (id: 1826010012)

12Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them had.


## Ezekiel 10:13 (id: 1826010013)

13As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”.


## Ezekiel 10:14 (id: 1826010014)

14Every one of them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. The third face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle.


## Ezekiel 10:15 (id: 1826010015)

15The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.


## Ezekiel 10:16 (id: 1826010016)

16When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them.


## Ezekiel 10:17 (id: 1826010017)

17When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.


## Ezekiel 10:18 (id: 1826010018)

18The LORD’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.


## Ezekiel 10:19 (id: 1826010019)

19The cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, with the wheels beside them. Then they stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.


## Ezekiel 10:20 (id: 1826010020)

20This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.


## Ezekiel 10:21 (id: 1826010021)

21Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.


## Ezekiel 10:22 (id: 1826010022)

22As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight forward.


## Ezekiel 11:1 (id: 1826011001)

1Moreover the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the LORD’s house, which looks eastward. Behold, twenty\-five men were at the door of the gate; and I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.


## Ezekiel 11:2 (id: 1826011002)

2He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;


## Ezekiel 11:3 (id: 1826011003)

3who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’


## Ezekiel 11:4 (id: 1826011004)

4Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.”


## Ezekiel 11:5 (id: 1826011005)

5The LORD’s Spirit fell on me, and he said to me, “Speak, ‘The LORD says: “Thus you have said, house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.


## Ezekiel 11:6 (id: 1826011006)

6You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.”


## Ezekiel 11:7 (id: 1826011007)

7“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says: “Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the meat, and this is the cauldron; but you will be brought out of the middle of it.


## Ezekiel 11:8 (id: 1826011008)

8You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 11:9 (id: 1826011009)

9“I will bring you out of the middle of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.


## Ezekiel 11:10 (id: 1826011010)

10You will fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.


## Ezekiel 11:11 (id: 1826011011)

11This will not be your cauldron, neither will you be the meat in the middle of it. I will judge you in the border of Israel.


## Ezekiel 11:12 (id: 1826011012)

12You will know that I am the LORD, for you have not walked in my statutes. You have not executed my ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you.”’”


## Ezekiel 11:13 (id: 1826011013)

13When I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord GOD! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?”


## Ezekiel 11:14 (id: 1826011014)

14The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 11:15 (id: 1826011015)

15“Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are the ones to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from the LORD. This land has been given to us for a possession.’


## Ezekiel 11:16 (id: 1826011016)

16“Therefore say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come.”’


## Ezekiel 11:17 (id: 1826011017)

17“Therefore say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.”


## Ezekiel 11:18 (id: 1826011018)

18“‘They will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.


## Ezekiel 11:19 (id: 1826011019)

19I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them. I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh,


## Ezekiel 11:20 (id: 1826011020)

20that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.


## Ezekiel 11:21 (id: 1826011021)

21But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way on their own heads,’ says the Lord GOD.”


## Ezekiel 11:22 (id: 1826011022)

22Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them. The glory of the God of Israel was over them above.


## Ezekiel 11:23 (id: 1826011023)

23The LORD’s glory went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.


## Ezekiel 11:24 (id: 1826011024)

24The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the captives. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.


## Ezekiel 11:25 (id: 1826011025)

25Then I spoke to the captives all the things that the LORD had shown me.


## Ezekiel 12:1 (id: 1826012001)

1The LORD’s word also came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:2 (id: 1826012002)

2“Son of man, you dwell in the middle of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and don’t see, who have ears to hear, and don’t hear; for they are a rebellious house.


## Ezekiel 12:3 (id: 1826012003)

3“Therefore, you son of man, prepare your baggage for moving, and move by day in their sight. You shall move from your place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.


## Ezekiel 12:4 (id: 1826012004)

4You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for moving. You shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as when men go out into exile.


## Ezekiel 12:5 (id: 1826012005)

5Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your baggage out that way.


## Ezekiel 12:6 (id: 1826012006)

6In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face, so that you don’t see the land, for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.”


## Ezekiel 12:7 (id: 1826012007)

7I did so as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it out in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight.


## Ezekiel 12:8 (id: 1826012008)

8In the morning, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:9 (id: 1826012009)

9“Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’


## Ezekiel 12:10 (id: 1826012010)

10“Say to them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.”’


## Ezekiel 12:11 (id: 1826012011)

11“Say, ‘I am your sign. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity.


## Ezekiel 12:12 (id: 1826012012)

12“‘The prince who is among them will bear his baggage on his shoulder in the dark, and will go out. They will dig through the wall to carry things out that way. He will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes.


## Ezekiel 12:13 (id: 1826012013)

13I will also spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there.


## Ezekiel 12:14 (id: 1826012014)

14I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his bands. I will draw out the sword after them.


## Ezekiel 12:15 (id: 1826012015)

15“‘They will know that I am the LORD when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries.


## Ezekiel 12:16 (id: 1826012016)

16But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”


## Ezekiel 12:17 (id: 1826012017)

17Moreover the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:18 (id: 1826012018)

18“Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness.


## Ezekiel 12:19 (id: 1826012019)

19Tell the people of the land, ‘The Lord GOD says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the land of Israel: “They will eat their bread with fearfulness and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and all that is therein, because of the violence of all those who dwell therein.


## Ezekiel 12:20 (id: 1826012020)

20The cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD.”’”


## Ezekiel 12:21 (id: 1826012021)

21The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:22 (id: 1826012022)

22“Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails’?


## Ezekiel 12:23 (id: 1826012023)

23Tell them therefore, ‘The Lord GOD says: “I will make this proverb to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel;”’ but tell them, ‘“The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.


## Ezekiel 12:24 (id: 1826012024)

24For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 12:25 (id: 1826012025)

25For I am the LORD. I will speak, and the word that I speak will be performed. It will be no more deferred; for in your days, rebellious house, I will speak the word and will perform it,” says the Lord GOD.’”


## Ezekiel 12:26 (id: 1826012026)

26Again the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:27 (id: 1826012027)

27“Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.’


## Ezekiel 12:28 (id: 1826012028)

28“Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “None of my words will be deferred any more, but the word which I speak will be performed,” says the Lord GOD.’”


## Ezekiel 13:1 (id: 1826013001)

1The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 13:2 (id: 1826013002)

2“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear the LORD’s word:


## Ezekiel 13:3 (id: 1826013003)

3The Lord GOD says, “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!


## Ezekiel 13:4 (id: 1826013004)

4Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.


## Ezekiel 13:5 (id: 1826013005)

5You have not gone up into the gaps or built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the LORD’s day.


## Ezekiel 13:6 (id: 1826013006)

6They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, ‘The LORD says;’ but the LORD has not sent them. They have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.


## Ezekiel 13:7 (id: 1826013007)

7Haven’t you seen a false vision, and haven’t you spoken a lying divination, in that you say, ‘The LORD says;’ but I have not spoken?”


## Ezekiel 13:8 (id: 1826013008)

8“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says: “Because you have spoken falsehood and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 13:9 (id: 1826013009)

9“My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who utter lying divinations. They will not be in the council of my people, neither will they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither will they enter into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.”


## Ezekiel 13:10 (id: 1826013010)

10“‘Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace;” and there is no peace. When one builds up a wall, behold, they plaster it with whitewash.


## Ezekiel 13:11 (id: 1826013011)

11Tell those who plaster it with whitewash that it will fall. There will be an overflowing shower; and you, great hailstones, will fall. A stormy wind will tear it.


## Ezekiel 13:12 (id: 1826013012)

12Behold, when the wall has fallen, won’t it be said to you, “Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it?”


## Ezekiel 13:13 (id: 1826013013)

13“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says: “I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath. There will be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.


## Ezekiel 13:14 (id: 1826013014)

14So I will break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered. It will fall, and you will be consumed in the middle of it. Then you will know that I am the LORD.


## Ezekiel 13:15 (id: 1826013015)

15Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have plastered it with whitewash. I will tell you, ‘The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it—


## Ezekiel 13:16 (id: 1826013016)

16to wit, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace,’” says the Lord GOD.’”


## Ezekiel 13:17 (id: 1826013017)

17You, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them,


## Ezekiel 13:18 (id: 1826013018)

18and say, “The Lord GOD says: ‘Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all elbows and make veils for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people and save souls alive for yourselves?


## Ezekiel 13:19 (id: 1826013019)

19You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.’


## Ezekiel 13:20 (id: 1826013020)

20“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am against your magic bands, with which you hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms. I will let the souls fly free, even the souls whom you ensnare like birds.


## Ezekiel 13:21 (id: 1826013021)

21I will also tear your veils and deliver my people out of your hand; and they will no longer be in your hand to be ensnared. Then you will know that I am the LORD.


## Ezekiel 13:22 (id: 1826013022)

22Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive.


## Ezekiel 13:23 (id: 1826013023)

23Therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’”


## Ezekiel 14:1 (id: 1826014001)

1Then some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.


## Ezekiel 14:2 (id: 1826014002)

2The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 14:3 (id: 1826014003)

3“Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face. Should I be inquired of at all by them?


## Ezekiel 14:4 (id: 1826014004)

4Therefore speak to them and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face then comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him there according to the multitude of his idols,


## Ezekiel 14:5 (id: 1826014005)

5that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.”’


## Ezekiel 14:6 (id: 1826014006)

6“Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Return, and turn yourselves from your idols! Turn away your faces from all your abominations.


## Ezekiel 14:7 (id: 1826014007)

7“‘“For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live in Israel, who separates himself from me and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire for himself of me, I the LORD will answer him by myself.


## Ezekiel 14:8 (id: 1826014008)

8I will set my face against that man and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from among my people. Then you will know that I am the LORD.


## Ezekiel 14:9 (id: 1826014009)

9“‘“If the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from among my people Israel.


## Ezekiel 14:10 (id: 1826014010)

10They will bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet will be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him,


## Ezekiel 14:11 (id: 1826014011)

11that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God,” says the Lord GOD.’”


## Ezekiel 14:12 (id: 1826014012)

12The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 14:13 (id: 1826014013)

13“Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff of its bread and send famine on it, and cut off from it man and animal—


## Ezekiel 14:14 (id: 1826014014)

14though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 14:15 (id: 1826014015)

15“If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they ravage it and it is made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the animals—


## Ezekiel 14:16 (id: 1826014016)

16though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They only would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.


## Ezekiel 14:17 (id: 1826014017)

17“Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land, so that I cut off from it man and animal’—


## Ezekiel 14:18 (id: 1826014018)

18though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only would be delivered themselves.


## Ezekiel 14:19 (id: 1826014019)

19“Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man and animal—


## Ezekiel 14:20 (id: 1826014020)

20though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness.”


## Ezekiel 14:21 (id: 1826014021)

21For the Lord GOD says: “How much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem—the sword, the famine, the evil animals, and the pestilence—to cut off from it man and animal!


## Ezekiel 14:22 (id: 1826014022)

22Yet, behold, there will be left a remnant in it that will be carried out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they will come out to you, and you will see their way and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.


## Ezekiel 14:23 (id: 1826014023)

23They will comfort you, when you see their way and their doings; then you will know that I have not done all that I have done in it without cause,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 15:1 (id: 1826015001)

1The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 15:2 (id: 1826015002)

2“Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?


## Ezekiel 15:3 (id: 1826015003)

3Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it?


## Ezekiel 15:4 (id: 1826015004)

4Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and the middle of it is burned. Is it profitable for any work?


## Ezekiel 15:5 (id: 1826015005)

5Behold, when it was whole, it was suitable for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it has been burned, will it yet be suitable for any work?”


## Ezekiel 15:6 (id: 1826015006)

6Therefore the Lord GOD says: “As the vine wood among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.


## Ezekiel 15:7 (id: 1826015007)

7I will set my face against them. They will go out from the fire, but the fire will still devour them. Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.


## Ezekiel 15:8 (id: 1826015008)

8I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 16:1 (id: 1826016001)

1Again the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 16:2 (id: 1826016002)

2“Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations;


## Ezekiel 16:3 (id: 1826016003)

3and say, ‘The Lord GOD says to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite. An Amorite was your father, and your mother was a Hittite.


## Ezekiel 16:4 (id: 1826016004)

4As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut. You weren’t washed in water to cleanse you. You weren’t salted at all, nor wrapped in blankets at all.


## Ezekiel 16:5 (id: 1826016005)

5No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, because you were abhorred in the day that you were born.


## Ezekiel 16:6 (id: 1826016006)

6“‘“When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ Yes, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’


## Ezekiel 16:7 (id: 1826016007)

7I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and grew great, and you attained to excellent beauty. Your breasts were formed, and your hair grew; yet you were naked and bare.


## Ezekiel 16:8 (id: 1826016008)

8“‘“Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my garment over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I pledged myself to you and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord GOD, “and you became mine.


## Ezekiel 16:9 (id: 1826016009)

9“‘“Then I washed you with water. Yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.


## Ezekiel 16:10 (id: 1826016010)

10I clothed you also with embroidered work and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.


## Ezekiel 16:11 (id: 1826016011)

11I decked you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands, and put a chain on your neck.


## Ezekiel 16:12 (id: 1826016012)

12I put a ring on your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.


## Ezekiel 16:13 (id: 1826016013)

13Thus you were decked with gold and silver. Your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered work. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate.


## Ezekiel 16:14 (id: 1826016014)

14Your renown went out among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 16:15 (id: 1826016015)

15“‘“But you trusted in your beauty, and played the prostitute because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by. It was his.


## Ezekiel 16:16 (id: 1826016016)

16You took some of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors, and played the prostitute on them. This shouldn’t happen, neither shall it be.


## Ezekiel 16:17 (id: 1826016017)

17You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and played the prostitute with them.


## Ezekiel 16:18 (id: 1826016018)

18You took your embroidered garments, covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them.


## Ezekiel 16:19 (id: 1826016019)

19My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma; and so it was,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 16:20 (id: 1826016020)

20“‘“Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured. Was your prostitution a small matter,


## Ezekiel 16:21 (id: 1826016021)

21that you have slain my children and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them?


## Ezekiel 16:22 (id: 1826016022)

22In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were wallowing in your blood.


## Ezekiel 16:23 (id: 1826016023)

23“‘“It has happened after all your wickedness—woe, woe to you!” says the Lord GOD—


## Ezekiel 16:24 (id: 1826016024)

24“that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street.


## Ezekiel 16:25 (id: 1826016025)

25You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution.


## Ezekiel 16:26 (id: 1826016026)

26You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger.


## Ezekiel 16:27 (id: 1826016027)

27See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your portion, and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.


## Ezekiel 16:28 (id: 1826016028)

28You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute with them, and yet you weren’t satisfied.


## Ezekiel 16:29 (id: 1826016029)

29You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren’t satisfied with this.


## Ezekiel 16:30 (id: 1826016030)

30“‘“How weak is your heart,” says the Lord GOD, “since you do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute;


## Ezekiel 16:31 (id: 1826016031)

31in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay.


## Ezekiel 16:32 (id: 1826016032)

32“‘“Adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband!


## Ezekiel 16:33 (id: 1826016033)

33People give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution.


## Ezekiel 16:34 (id: 1826016034)

34You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.”’


## Ezekiel 16:35 (id: 1826016035)

35“Therefore, prostitute, hear the LORD’s word:


## Ezekiel 16:36 (id: 1826016036)

36‘The Lord GOD says, “Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you gave to them;


## Ezekiel 16:37 (id: 1826016037)

37therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those whom you have loved, with all those whom you have hated. I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.


## Ezekiel 16:38 (id: 1826016038)

38I will judge you as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.


## Ezekiel 16:39 (id: 1826016039)

39I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places. They will strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels. They will leave you naked and bare.


## Ezekiel 16:40 (id: 1826016040)

40They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.


## Ezekiel 16:41 (id: 1826016041)

41They will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute, and you will also give no hire any more.


## Ezekiel 16:42 (id: 1826016042)

42So I will cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you. I will be quiet, and will not be angry any more.


## Ezekiel 16:43 (id: 1826016043)

43“‘“Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring your way on your head,” says the Lord GOD: “and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your abominations.

44“‘“Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb against you, saying, ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’

45You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.


## Ezekiel 16:46 (id: 1826016046)

46Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, is Sodom with her daughters.


## Ezekiel 16:47 (id: 1826016047)

47Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor done their abominations; but soon you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.


## Ezekiel 16:48 (id: 1826016048)

48As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.

49“‘“Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters. She also didn’t strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.


## Ezekiel 16:50 (id: 1826016050)

50They were arrogant and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away when I saw it.


## Ezekiel 16:51 (id: 1826016051)

51Samaria hasn’t committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done.


## Ezekiel 16:52 (id: 1826016052)

52You also bear your own shame yourself, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than you. Yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.


## Ezekiel 16:53 (id: 1826016053)

53“‘“I will reverse their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives among them;

55Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your former estate.


## Ezekiel 16:56 (id: 1826016056)

56For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,


## Ezekiel 16:57 (id: 1826016057)

57before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you all around.

## Ezekiel 17:1 (id: 1826017001)

1The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 17:2 (id: 1826017002)

2“Son of man, tell a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;


## Ezekiel 17:3 (id: 1826017003)

3and say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “A great eagle with great wings and long feathers, full of feathers which had various colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.


## Ezekiel 17:4 (id: 1826017004)

4He cropped off the topmost of its young twigs, and carried it to a land of traffic. He planted it in a city of merchants.


## Ezekiel 17:5 (id: 1826017005)

5“‘“He also took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it as a willow tree.


## Ezekiel 17:6 (id: 1826017006)

6It grew and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So it became a vine, produced branches, and shot out sprigs.


## Ezekiel 17:7 (id: 1826017007)

7“‘“There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. Behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot out its branches toward him, from the ground where it was planted, that he might water it.


## Ezekiel 17:8 (id: 1826017008)

8It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might produce branches and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a good vine.”’


## Ezekiel 17:9 (id: 1826017009)

9“Say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Will it prosper? Won’t he pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, that it may wither, that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? It can’t be raised from its roots by a strong arm or many people.


## Ezekiel 17:10 (id: 1826017010)

10Yes, behold, being planted, will it prosper? Won’t it utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in the ground where it grew.”’”


## Ezekiel 17:11 (id: 1826017011)

11Moreover the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 17:12 (id: 1826017012)

12“Say now to the rebellious house, ‘Don’t you know what these things mean?’ Tell them, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to him to Babylon.


## Ezekiel 17:13 (id: 1826017013)

13He took one of the royal offspring, and made a covenant with him. He also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land,


## Ezekiel 17:14 (id: 1826017014)

14that the kingdom might be brought low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.


## Ezekiel 17:15 (id: 1826017015)

15But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the covenant, and still escape?


## Ezekiel 17:16 (id: 1826017016)

16“‘As I live,’ says the Lord GOD, ‘surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he will die.

## Ezekiel 20:7 (id: 1826020007)

7I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of his eyes. Don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.’

8“‘“But they rebelled against me and wouldn’t listen to me. They didn’t all throw away the abominations of their eyes. They also didn’t forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 20:9 (id: 1826020009)

9But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 20:10 (id: 1826020010)

10So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.


## Ezekiel 20:11 (id: 1826020011)

11I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he will live in them.

12Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.

13“‘“But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn’t walk in my statutes and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them.


## Ezekiel 20:14 (id: 1826020014)

14But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.

15Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands,


## Ezekiel 20:16 (id: 1826020016)

16because they rejected my ordinances, and didn’t walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.


## Ezekiel 20:17 (id: 1826020017)

17Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn’t destroy them. I didn’t make a full end of them in the wilderness.


## Ezekiel 20:18 (id: 1826020018)

18I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Don’t walk in the statutes of your fathers. Don’t observe their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.

## Ezekiel 20:23 (id: 1826020023)

23Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,


## Ezekiel 20:24 (id: 1826020024)

24because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.


## Ezekiel 20:25 (id: 1826020025)

25Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they couldn’t live.


## Ezekiel 20:26 (id: 1826020026)

26I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.”’


## Ezekiel 20:27 (id: 1826020027)

27“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Moreover, in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.

28For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There they also made their pleasant aroma, and there they poured out their drink offerings.

37“I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.


## Ezekiel 20:38 (id: 1826020038)

## Ezekiel 20:45 (id: 1826020045)

45The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 20:46 (id: 1826020046)

46“Son of man, set your face toward the south, and preach toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the south.


## Ezekiel 20:47 (id: 1826020047)

47Tell the forest of the south, ‘Hear the LORD’s word: The Lord GOD says, “Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree. The burning flame will not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north will be burned by it.

48All flesh will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it. It will not be quenched.”’”

## Ezekiel 21:4 (id: 1826021004)

4Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword will go out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.

5All flesh will know that I, the LORD, have drawn my sword out of its sheath. It will not return any more.”’

6“Therefore sigh, you son of man. You shall sigh before their eyes with a broken heart and with bitterness.


## Ezekiel 21:7 (id: 1826021007)

7It shall be, when they ask you, ‘Why do you sigh?’ that you shall say, ‘Because of the news, for it comes! Every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord GOD.’”


## Ezekiel 21:8 (id: 1826021008)

8The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 21:9 (id: 1826021009)

9“Son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘The LORD says: “A sword! A sword! It is sharpened, and also polished.


## Ezekiel 21:10 (id: 1826021010)

10It is sharpened that it may make a slaughter. It is polished that it may be as lightning. Should we then make mirth? The rod of my son condemns every tree.


## Ezekiel 21:11 (id: 1826021011)

11It is given to be polished, that it may be handled. The sword is sharpened. Yes, it is polished to give it into the hand of the killer.”’


## Ezekiel 21:12 (id: 1826021012)

12Cry and wail, son of man; for it is on my people. It is on all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Therefore beat your thigh.


## Ezekiel 21:13 (id: 1826021013)

13“For there is a trial. What if even the rod that condemns will be no more?” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 21:14 (id: 1826021014)

14“You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together. Let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the fatally wounded. It is the sword of the great one who is fatally wounded, which enters into their rooms.


## Ezekiel 21:15 (id: 1826021015)

15I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied. Ah! It is made as lightning. It is pointed for slaughter.

16Gather yourselves together. Go to the right. Set yourselves in array. Go to the left, wherever your face is set.

19“Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. They both will come out of one land, and mark out a place. Mark it out at the head of the way to the city.


## Ezekiel 21:20 (id: 1826021020)

20You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.


## Ezekiel 21:21 (id: 1826021021)

21For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook the arrows back and forth. He consulted the teraphim. He looked in the liver.


## Ezekiel 21:22 (id: 1826021022)

22In his right hand was the lot for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, and to build forts.


## Ezekiel 21:23 (id: 1826021023)

23It will be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory, that they may be taken.


## Ezekiel 21:24 (id: 1826021024)

24“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have caused your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to memory, you will be taken with the hand.


## Ezekiel 21:25 (id: 1826021025)

25“‘You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,


## Ezekiel 21:26 (id: 1826021026)

26the Lord GOD says: “Remove the turban, and take off the crown. This will not be as it was. Exalt that which is low, and humble that which is high.


## Ezekiel 21:27 (id: 1826021027)

27I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. This also will be no more, until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it.”’


## Ezekiel 21:28 (id: 1826021028)

28“You, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord GOD says this concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach: “A sword! A sword is drawn! It is polished for the slaughter, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;


## Ezekiel 21:29 (id: 1826021029)

29while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies to you, to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end.


## Ezekiel 21:30 (id: 1826021030)

30Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, I will judge you.


## Ezekiel 21:31 (id: 1826021031)

31I will pour out my indignation on you. I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath. I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, skillful to destroy.


## Ezekiel 21:32 (id: 1826021032)

32You will be for fuel to the fire. Your blood will be in the middle of the land. You will be remembered no more; for I, the LORD, have spoken it.”’”


## Ezekiel 22:1 (id: 1826022001)

1Moreover the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 22:2 (id: 1826022002)

2“You, son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations.


## Ezekiel 22:3 (id: 1826022003)

3You shall say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “A city that sheds blood within herself, that her time may come, and that makes idols against herself to defile her!


## Ezekiel 22:4 (id: 1826022004)

4You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed, and are defiled in your idols which you have made! You have caused your days to draw near, and have come to the end of your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.


## Ezekiel 22:5 (id: 1826022005)

5Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult.


## Ezekiel 22:6 (id: 1826022006)

6“‘“Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his power, have been in you to shed blood.


## Ezekiel 22:7 (id: 1826022007)

7In you have they treated father and mother with contempt. Among you they have oppressed the foreigner. In you they have wronged the fatherless and the widow.


## Ezekiel 22:8 (id: 1826022008)

8You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths.


## Ezekiel 22:9 (id: 1826022009)

9Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood. In you they have eaten on the mountains. They have committed lewdness among you.


## Ezekiel 22:10 (id: 1826022010)

10In you have they uncovered their fathers’ nakedness. In you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity.


## Ezekiel 22:11 (id: 1826022011)

11One has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife, and another has lewdly defiled his daughter\-in\-law. Another in you has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.


## Ezekiel 22:12 (id: 1826022012)

12In you have they taken bribes to shed blood. You have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 22:13 (id: 1826022013)

13“‘“Behold, therefore I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at the blood which has been shed within you.


## Ezekiel 22:14 (id: 1826022014)

14Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I will deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken it, and will do it.


## Ezekiel 22:15 (id: 1826022015)

15I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through the countries. I will purge your filthiness out of you.


## Ezekiel 22:16 (id: 1826022016)

16You will be profaned in yourself in the sight of the nations. Then you will know that I am the LORD.”’”


## Ezekiel 22:17 (id: 1826022017)

17The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 22:18 (id: 1826022018)

18“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are bronze, tin, iron, and lead in the middle of the furnace. They are the dross of silver.


## Ezekiel 22:19 (id: 1826022019)

19Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the middle of Jerusalem.


## Ezekiel 22:20 (id: 1826022020)

20As they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it, so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there and melt you.


## Ezekiel 22:21 (id: 1826022021)

21Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the middle of it.


## Ezekiel 22:22 (id: 1826022022)

22As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so you will be melted in the middle of it; and you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out my wrath on you.’”


## Ezekiel 22:23 (id: 1826022023)

23The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 22:24 (id: 1826022024)

24“Son of man, tell her, ‘You are a land that is not cleansed nor rained on in the day of indignation.’


## Ezekiel 22:25 (id: 1826022025)

25There is a conspiracy of her prophets within it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey. They have devoured souls. They take treasure and precious things. They have made many widows within it.


## Ezekiel 22:26 (id: 1826022026)

26Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from my Sabbaths. So I am profaned among them.


## Ezekiel 22:27 (id: 1826022027)

27Her princes within it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.


## Ezekiel 22:28 (id: 1826022028)

28Her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash, seeing false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, ‘The Lord GOD says,’ when the LORD has not spoken.


## Ezekiel 22:29 (id: 1826022029)

29The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery. Yes, they have troubled the poor and needy, and have oppressed the foreigner wrongfully.


## Ezekiel 22:30 (id: 1826022030)

30“I sought for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I would not destroy it; but I found no one.


## Ezekiel 22:31 (id: 1826022031)

31Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have brought their own way on their heads,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 23:1 (id: 1826023001)

1The LORD’s word came again to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 23:2 (id: 1826023002)

2“Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.


## Ezekiel 23:3 (id: 1826023003)

3They played the prostitute in Egypt. They played the prostitute in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their youthful nipples were caressed there.


## Ezekiel 23:4 (id: 1826023004)

4Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.


## Ezekiel 23:5 (id: 1826023005)

5“Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,


## Ezekiel 23:6 (id: 1826023006)

6who were clothed with blue—governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.


## Ezekiel 23:7 (id: 1826023007)

7She gave herself as a prostitute to them, all of them the choicest men of Assyria. She defiled herself with the idols of whomever she lusted after.


## Ezekiel 23:8 (id: 1826023008)

8She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They caressed her youthful nipples and they poured out their prostitution on her.


## Ezekiel 23:9 (id: 1826023009)

9“Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians on whom she doted.


## Ezekiel 23:10 (id: 1826023010)

10These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her.


## Ezekiel 23:11 (id: 1826023011)

11“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lusting than she, and in her prostitution which was more depraved than the prostitution of her sister.


## Ezekiel 23:12 (id: 1826023012)

12She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers—her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.


## Ezekiel 23:13 (id: 1826023013)

13I saw that she was defiled. They both went the same way.


## Ezekiel 23:14 (id: 1826023014)

14“She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with red,


## Ezekiel 23:15 (id: 1826023015)

15dressed with belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like princes, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.


## Ezekiel 23:16 (id: 1826023016)

16As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.


## Ezekiel 23:17 (id: 1826023017)

17The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution. She was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.


## Ezekiel 23:18 (id: 1826023018)

18So she uncovered her prostitution and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just like my soul was alienated from her sister.


## Ezekiel 23:19 (id: 1826023019)

19Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 23:20 (id: 1826023020)

20She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.


## Ezekiel 23:21 (id: 1826023021)

21Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the caressing of your nipples by the Egyptians because of your youthful breasts.


## Ezekiel 23:22 (id: 1826023022)

22“Therefore, Oholibah, the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side:


## Ezekiel 23:23 (id: 1826023023)

23the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.


## Ezekiel 23:24 (id: 1826023024)

24They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you with buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their judgments.


## Ezekiel 23:25 (id: 1826023025)

25I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will take away your nose and your ears. Your remnant will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and the rest of you will be devoured by the fire.


## Ezekiel 23:26 (id: 1826023026)

26They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.


## Ezekiel 23:27 (id: 1826023027)

27Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and remove your prostitution from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.’


## Ezekiel 23:28 (id: 1826023028)

28“For the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated.


## Ezekiel 23:29 (id: 1826023029)

29They will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and will leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution.


## Ezekiel 23:30 (id: 1826023030)

30These things will be done to you because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols.


## Ezekiel 23:31 (id: 1826023031)

31You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.’


## Ezekiel 23:32 (id: 1826023032)

32“The Lord GOD says: ‘You will drink of your sister’s cup, which is deep and large. You will be ridiculed and held in derision. It contains much.


## Ezekiel 23:33 (id: 1826023033)

33You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.


## Ezekiel 23:34 (id: 1826023034)

34You will even drink it and drain it out. You will gnaw the broken pieces of it, and will tear your breasts; for I have spoken it,’ says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 23:35 (id: 1826023035)

35“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, therefore you also bear your lewdness and your prostitution.’”


## Ezekiel 23:36 (id: 1826023036)

36The LORD said moreover to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.


## Ezekiel 23:37 (id: 1826023037)

37For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured.


## Ezekiel 23:38 (id: 1826023038)

38Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.


## Ezekiel 23:39 (id: 1826023039)

39For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, they have done this in the middle of my house.


## Ezekiel 23:40 (id: 1826023040)

40“Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments,


## Ezekiel 23:41 (id: 1826023041)

41and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil.


## Ezekiel 23:42 (id: 1826023042)

42“The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.


## Ezekiel 23:43 (id: 1826023043)

43Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, ‘Now they will play the prostitute with her, and she with them.’


## Ezekiel 23:44 (id: 1826023044)

44They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.


## Ezekiel 23:45 (id: 1826023045)

45Righteous men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.


## Ezekiel 23:46 (id: 1826023046)

46“For the Lord GOD says: ‘I will bring up a mob against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed.


## Ezekiel 23:47 (id: 1826023047)

47The company will stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords. They will kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.


## Ezekiel 23:48 (id: 1826023048)

48“‘Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to be lewd like you.


## Ezekiel 23:49 (id: 1826023049)

49They will recompense your lewdness on you, and you will bear the sins of your idols. Then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’”


## Ezekiel 24:1 (id: 1826024001)

1Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 24:2 (id: 1826024002)

2“Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.


## Ezekiel 24:3 (id: 1826024003)

3Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says, “Put the cauldron on the fire. Put it on, and also pour water into it.


## Ezekiel 24:4 (id: 1826024004)

4Gather its pieces into it, even every good piece: the thigh and the shoulder. Fill it with the choice bones.


## Ezekiel 24:5 (id: 1826024005)

5Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron. Make it boil well. Yes, let its bones be boiled within it.”


## Ezekiel 24:6 (id: 1826024006)

6“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says: “Woe to the bloody city, to the cauldron whose rust is in it, and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece without casting lots for it.


## Ezekiel 24:7 (id: 1826024007)

7“‘“For the blood she shed is in the middle of her. She set it on the bare rock. She didn’t pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.


## Ezekiel 24:8 (id: 1826024008)

8That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.”


## Ezekiel 24:9 (id: 1826024009)

9“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says: “Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.


## Ezekiel 24:10 (id: 1826024010)

10Heap on the wood. Make the fire hot. Boil the meat well. Make the broth thick, and let the bones be burned.


## Ezekiel 24:11 (id: 1826024011)

11Then set it empty on its coals, that it may be hot, and its bronze may burn, and that its filthiness may be molten in it, that its rust may be consumed.


## Ezekiel 24:12 (id: 1826024012)

12She is weary with toil; yet her great rust, rust by fire, doesn’t leave her.


## Ezekiel 24:13 (id: 1826024013)

13“‘“In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.


## Ezekiel 24:14 (id: 1826024014)

14“‘“I, the LORD, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According to your ways and according to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lord GOD.’”


## Ezekiel 24:15 (id: 1826024015)

15Also the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 24:16 (id: 1826024016)

16“Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.


## Ezekiel 24:17 (id: 1826024017)

17Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.”


## Ezekiel 24:18 (id: 1826024018)

18So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded.


## Ezekiel 24:19 (id: 1826024019)

19The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things mean to us, that you act like this?”


## Ezekiel 24:20 (id: 1826024020)

20Then I said to them, “The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 24:21 (id: 1826024021)

21‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.


## Ezekiel 24:22 (id: 1826024022)

22You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread.


## Ezekiel 24:23 (id: 1826024023)

23Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.


## Ezekiel 24:24 (id: 1826024024)

24Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’”’”


## Ezekiel 24:25 (id: 1826024025)

25“You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart—their sons and their daughters—


## Ezekiel 24:26 (id: 1826024026)

26that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?


## Ezekiel 24:27 (id: 1826024027)

27In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak and be no more mute. So you will be a sign to them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”


## Ezekiel 25:1 (id: 1826025001)

1The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 25:2 (id: 1826025002)

2“Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them.


## Ezekiel 25:3 (id: 1826025003)

3Tell the children of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord GOD! The Lord GOD says, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity,


## Ezekiel 25:4 (id: 1826025004)

4therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession. They will set their encampments in you and make their dwellings in you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk.


## Ezekiel 25:5 (id: 1826025005)

5I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you will know that I am the LORD.”


## Ezekiel 25:6 (id: 1826025006)

6For the Lord GOD says: “Because you have clapped your hands, stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the contempt of your soul against the land of Israel,


## Ezekiel 25:7 (id: 1826025007)

7therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries. I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.”


## Ezekiel 25:8 (id: 1826025008)

8“‘The Lord GOD says: “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,’


## Ezekiel 25:9 (id: 1826025009)

9therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on its frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim,


## Ezekiel 25:10 (id: 1826025010)

10to the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.


## Ezekiel 25:11 (id: 1826025011)

11I will execute judgments on Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”


## Ezekiel 25:12 (id: 1826025012)

12“‘The Lord GOD says: “Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and taken revenge on them,”

19Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”’”


## Ezekiel 30:20 (id: 1826030020)

20In the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 30:21 (id: 1826030021)

21“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Behold, it has not been bound up, to apply medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it may become strong to hold the sword.


## Ezekiel 30:22 (id: 1826030022)

22Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong arm, and that which was broken. I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.


## Ezekiel 30:23 (id: 1826030023)

23I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.


## Ezekiel 30:24 (id: 1826030024)

24I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before the king of Babylon with the groaning of a mortally wounded man.


## Ezekiel 30:25 (id: 1826030025)

25I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall down. Then they will know that I am the LORD when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he stretches it out on the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 30:26 (id: 1826030026)

26I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”


## Ezekiel 31:1 (id: 1826031001)

1In the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 31:2 (id: 1826031002)

2“Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt and his multitude: ‘Whom are you like in your greatness?


## Ezekiel 31:3 (id: 1826031003)

3Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, and with a forest\-like shade, of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.


## Ezekiel 31:4 (id: 1826031004)

4The waters nourished it. The deep made it to grow. Its rivers ran all around its plantation. It sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.


## Ezekiel 31:5 (id: 1826031005)

5Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied. Its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it spread them out.


## Ezekiel 31:6 (id: 1826031006)

6All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs. Under its branches, all the animals of the field gave birth to their young. All great nations lived under its shadow.


## Ezekiel 31:7 (id: 1826031007)

7Thus it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.


## Ezekiel 31:8 (id: 1826031008)

8The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it. The cypress trees were not like its branches. The pine trees were not like its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.


## Ezekiel 31:9 (id: 1826031009)

9I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.’


## Ezekiel 31:10 (id: 1826031010)

10“Therefore thus said the Lord GOD: ‘Because he is exalted in stature, and he has set his top among the thick branches, and his heart is lifted up in his height,


## Ezekiel 31:11 (id: 1826031011)

11I will deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He will surely deal with him. I have driven him out for his wickedness.


## Ezekiel 31:12 (id: 1826031012)

12Foreigners, the tyrants of the nations, have cut him off and have left him. His branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land. All the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow and have left him.


## Ezekiel 31:13 (id: 1826031013)

13All the birds of the sky will dwell on his ruin, and all the animals of the field will be on his branches,


## Ezekiel 31:14 (id: 1826031014)

14to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, and don’t set their top among the thick boughs. Their mighty ones don’t stand up on their height, even all who drink water; for they are all delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, among the children of men, with those who go down to the pit.’


## Ezekiel 31:15 (id: 1826031015)

15“The Lord GOD says: ‘In the day when he went down to Sheol, I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers. The great waters were stopped. I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.


## Ezekiel 31:16 (id: 1826031016)

16I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit. All the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.


## Ezekiel 31:17 (id: 1826031017)

17They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, who lived under his shadow in the middle of the nations.


## Ezekiel 31:18 (id: 1826031018)

18“‘To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth. You will lie in the middle of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. “‘This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,’ says the Lord GOD.”


## Ezekiel 32:1 (id: 1826032001)

1In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, “the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 32:2 (id: 1826032002)

2‘Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him, “You were likened to a young lion of the nations; yet you are as a monster in the seas. You broke out with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.”


## Ezekiel 32:3 (id: 1826032003)

3The Lord GOD says: “I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples. They will bring you up in my net.


## Ezekiel 32:4 (id: 1826032004)

4I will leave you on the land. I will cast you out on the open field, and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you. I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you.


## Ezekiel 32:5 (id: 1826032005)

5I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height.


## Ezekiel 32:6 (id: 1826032006)

6I will also water the land in which you swim with your blood, even to the mountains. The watercourses will be full of you.


## Ezekiel 32:7 (id: 1826032007)

7When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and make its stars dark. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon won’t give its light.


## Ezekiel 32:8 (id: 1826032008)

8I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you, and set darkness on your land,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 32:9 (id: 1826032009)

9“I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.


## Ezekiel 32:10 (id: 1826032010)

10Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, and their kings will be horribly afraid for you, when I brandish my sword before them. They will tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.”


## Ezekiel 32:11 (id: 1826032011)

11For the Lord GOD says: “The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you.


## Ezekiel 32:12 (id: 1826032012)

12I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of the mighty. They are all the ruthless of the nations. They will bring the pride of Egypt to nothing, and all its multitude will be destroyed.


## Ezekiel 32:13 (id: 1826032013)

13I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters. The foot of man won’t trouble them any more, nor will the hoofs of animals trouble them.


## Ezekiel 32:14 (id: 1826032014)

14Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil,” says the Lord GOD.


## Ezekiel 32:15 (id: 1826032015)

15“When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I strike all those who dwell therein, then they will know that I am the LORD.


## Ezekiel 32:16 (id: 1826032016)

16“‘“This is the lamentation with which they will lament. The daughters of the nations will lament with this. They will lament with it over Egypt, and over all her multitude,” says the Lord GOD.’”


## Ezekiel 32:17 (id: 1826032017)

17Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 32:18 (id: 1826032018)

18“Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.


## Ezekiel 32:19 (id: 1826032019)

19Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.


## Ezekiel 32:20 (id: 1826032020)

20They will fall among those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her away with all her multitudes.


## Ezekiel 32:21 (id: 1826032021)

23whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.


## Ezekiel 32:24 (id: 1826032024)

24“There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit.


## Ezekiel 32:25 (id: 1826032025)

25They have made Elam a bed among the slain with all her multitude.

He is put among those who are slain.


## Ezekiel 32:26 (id: 1826032026)

26“There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude. Their graves are around them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.


## Ezekiel 32:27 (id: 1826032027)

27They will not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war and have laid their swords under their heads. Their iniquities are on their bones; for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.


## Ezekiel 32:28 (id: 1826032028)

1The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 33:2 (id: 1826033002)

2“Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, ‘When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman,


## Ezekiel 33:3 (id: 1826033003)

3if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blows the trumpet and warns the people,


## Ezekiel 33:4 (id: 1826033004)

4then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and doesn’t heed the warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.


## Ezekiel 33:5 (id: 1826033005)

5He heard the sound of the trumpet and didn’t take warning. His blood will be on him; whereas if he had heeded the warning, he would have delivered his soul.


## Ezekiel 33:6 (id: 1826033006)

6But if the watchman sees the sword come and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’


## Ezekiel 33:7 (id: 1826033007)

7“So you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warnings from me.


## Ezekiel 33:8 (id: 1826033008)

8When I tell the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you don’t speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at your hand.


## Ezekiel 33:9 (id: 1826033009)

9Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he doesn’t turn from his way; he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.


## Ezekiel 33:10 (id: 1826033010)

10“You, son of man, tell the house of Israel: ‘You say this, “Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we pine away in them. How then can we live?”’


## Ezekiel 33:11 (id: 1826033011)

## Ezekiel 33:12 (id: 1826033012)

12“You, son of man, tell the children of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day of his disobedience. And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not fall by it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither will he who is righteous be able to live by it in the day that he sins.


## Ezekiel 33:13 (id: 1826033013)

13When I tell the righteous that he will surely live, if he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but he will die in his iniquity that he has committed.


## Ezekiel 33:14 (id: 1826033014)

14Again, when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die,” if he turns from his sin and does that which is lawful and right,


## Ezekiel 33:15 (id: 1826033015)

15if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity, he will surely live. He will not die.


## Ezekiel 33:16 (id: 1826033016)

16None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done that which is lawful and right. He will surely live.


## Ezekiel 33:17 (id: 1826033017)

17“‘Yet the children of your people say, “The way of the Lord is not fair;” but as for them, their way is not fair.


## Ezekiel 33:18 (id: 1826033018)

18When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will even die therein.


## Ezekiel 33:19 (id: 1826033019)

19When the wicked turns from his wickedness and does that which is lawful and right, he will live by it.


## Ezekiel 33:20 (id: 1826033020)

## Ezekiel 33:22 (id: 1826033022)

22Now the LORD’s hand had been on me in the evening, before he who had escaped came; and he had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.


## Ezekiel 33:23 (id: 1826033023)

23The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 33:24 (id: 1826033024)

24“Son of man, those who inhabit the waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, ‘Abraham was one, and he inherited the land; but we are many. The land is given us for inheritance.’


## Ezekiel 33:25 (id: 1826033025)

25Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. So should you possess the land?


## Ezekiel 33:26 (id: 1826033026)

26You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and every one of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. So should you possess the land?”’


## Ezekiel 33:27 (id: 1826033027)

27“You shall tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword. I will give whoever is in the open field to the animals to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of the pestilence.


## Ezekiel 33:28 (id: 1826033028)

28I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment. The pride of her power will cease. The mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that no one will pass through.


## Ezekiel 33:29 (id: 1826033029)

29Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment because of all their abominations which they have committed.”’


## Ezekiel 33:30 (id: 1826033030)

30“As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk about you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak to one another, everyone to his brother, saying, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that comes out from the LORD.’


## Ezekiel 33:31 (id: 1826033031)

31They come to you as the people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but don’t do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.


## Ezekiel 33:32 (id: 1826033032)

32Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they don’t do them.

33“When this comes to pass—behold, it comes—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”


## Ezekiel 34:1 (id: 1826034001)

1The LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 34:2 (id: 1826034002)

2“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and tell them, even the shepherds, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds feed the sheep?


## Ezekiel 34:3 (id: 1826034003)

3You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You kill the fatlings, but you don’t feed the sheep.


## Ezekiel 34:4 (id: 1826034004)

4You haven’t strengthened the diseased. You haven’t healed that which was sick. You haven’t bound up that which was broken. You haven’t brought back that which was driven away. You haven’t sought that which was lost, but you have ruled over them with force and with rigor.


## Ezekiel 34:5 (id: 1826034005)

5They were scattered, because there was no shepherd. They became food to all the animals of the field, and were scattered.


## Ezekiel 34:6 (id: 1826034006)

6My sheep wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. Yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth. There was no one who searched or sought.”

7“‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the LORD’s word:


## Ezekiel 34:8 (id: 1826034008)

8“As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field, because there was no shepherd, and my shepherds didn’t search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and didn’t feed my sheep,


## Ezekiel 34:9 (id: 1826034009)

9therefore, you shepherds, hear the LORD’s word!”


## Ezekiel 34:10 (id: 1826034010)

10The Lord GOD says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds. I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. The shepherds won’t feed themselves any more. I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.”


## Ezekiel 34:11 (id: 1826034011)

11“‘For the Lord GOD says: “Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.


## Ezekiel 34:12 (id: 1826034012)

12As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so I will seek out my sheep. I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.


## Ezekiel 34:13 (id: 1826034013)

13I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.


## Ezekiel 34:14 (id: 1826034014)

14I will feed them with good pasture, and their fold will be on the mountains of the height of Israel. There they will lie down in a good fold. They will feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.

17“As for you, O my flock, the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats.


## Ezekiel 34:18 (id: 1826034018)

18Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? And to have drunk of the clear waters, but must you foul the residue with your feet?


## Ezekiel 34:19 (id: 1826034019)

19As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.’

20“Therefore the Lord GOD says to them: ‘Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.

21Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad,

1Moreover the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 35:2 (id: 1826035002)

2“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,


## Ezekiel 35:3 (id: 1826035003)

3and tell it, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you. I will make you a desolation and an astonishment.


## Ezekiel 35:4 (id: 1826035004)

4I will lay your cities waste, and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.

5“‘“Because you have had a perpetual hostility, and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end,


## Ezekiel 35:6 (id: 1826035006)

6therefore, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will prepare you for blood, and blood will pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, therefore blood will pursue you.


## Ezekiel 35:7 (id: 1826035007)

7Thus I will make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation. I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns.

8I will fill its mountains with its slain. The slain with the sword will fall in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses.

11therefore, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will do according to your anger, and according to your envy which you have shown out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.


## Ezekiel 35:12 (id: 1826035012)

12You will know that I, the LORD, have heard all your insults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They have been laid desolate. They have been given to us to devour.’

3therefore prophesy, and say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and you are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;”


## Ezekiel 36:4 (id: 1826036004)

4therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: The Lord GOD says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are all around;


## Ezekiel 36:5 (id: 1826036005)

5therefore the Lord GOD says: “Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.”’


## Ezekiel 36:6 (id: 1826036006)

## Ezekiel 36:16 (id: 1826036016)

16Moreover the LORD’s word came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 36:17 (id: 1826036017)

17“Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and by their deeds. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.


## Ezekiel 36:18 (id: 1826036018)

18Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.


## Ezekiel 36:19 (id: 1826036019)

19I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their way and according to their deeds.


## Ezekiel 36:20 (id: 1826036020)

20When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name, in that men said of them, ‘These are the LORD’s people, and have left his land.’


## Ezekiel 36:21 (id: 1826036021)

21But I had respect for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.


## Ezekiel 36:22 (id: 1826036022)

22“Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord GOD says: “I don’t do this for your sake, house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.


## Ezekiel 36:23 (id: 1826036023)

23I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD,” says the Lord GOD, “when I am proven holy in you before their eyes.

34The land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.


## Ezekiel 36:35 (id: 1826036035)

35They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The waste, desolate, and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’


## Ezekiel 36:36 (id: 1826036036)

36Then the nations that are left around you will know that I, the LORD, have built the ruined places and planted that which was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken it, and I will do it.”

## Ezekiel 37:1 (id: 1826037001)

1The LORD’s hand was on me, and he brought me out in the LORD’s Spirit, and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones.


## Ezekiel 37:2 (id: 1826037002)

2He caused me to pass by them all around; and behold, there were very many in the open valley, and behold, they were very dry.


## Ezekiel 37:3 (id: 1826037003)

3He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I answered, “Lord GOD, you know.”


## Ezekiel 37:4 (id: 1826037004)

4Again he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, ‘You dry bones, hear the LORD’s word.


## Ezekiel 37:5 (id: 1826037005)

5The Lord GOD says to these bones: “Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you will live.


## Ezekiel 37:6 (id: 1826037006)

6I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you will live. Then you will know that I am the LORD.”’”


## Ezekiel 37:7 (id: 1826037007)

7So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, there was an earthquake. Then the bones came together, bone to its bone.


## Ezekiel 37:8 (id: 1826037008)

8I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.


## Ezekiel 37:9 (id: 1826037009)

9Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”’”


## Ezekiel 37:10 (id: 1826037010)

10So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army.


## Ezekiel 37:11 (id: 1826037011)

11Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are completely cut off.’


## Ezekiel 37:12 (id: 1826037012)

12Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.


## Ezekiel 37:13 (id: 1826037013)

13You will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.

19tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand.

20The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.”’


## Ezekiel 37:21 (id: 1826037021)

21Say to them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land.


## Ezekiel 37:22 (id: 1826037022)

22I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. One king will be king to them all. They will no longer be two nations. They won’t be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.


## Ezekiel 37:23 (id: 1826037023)

23They won’t defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. So they will be my people, and I will be their God.

17“You, son of man, the Lord GOD says: ‘Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every animal of the field, “Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat meat and drink blood.


## Ezekiel 39:18 (id: 1826039018)

18You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

20You shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men, and with all men of war,” says the Lord GOD.’


## Ezekiel 39:21 (id: 1826039021)

21“I will set my glory among the nations. Then all the nations will see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them.


## Ezekiel 39:22 (id: 1826039022)

22So the house of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God, from that day and forward.


## Ezekiel 39:23 (id: 1826039023)

23The nations will know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword.


## Ezekiel 39:24 (id: 1826039024)

24I did to them according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions. I hid my face from them.


## Ezekiel 39:25 (id: 1826039025)

25“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Now I will reverse the captivity of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel. I will be jealous for my holy name.


## Ezekiel 39:26 (id: 1826039026)

26They will forget their shame and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they dwell securely in their land. No one will make them afraid


## Ezekiel 39:27 (id: 1826039027)

27when I have brought them back from the peoples, gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am shown holy among them in the sight of many nations.


## Ezekiel 39:28 (id: 1826039028)

28They will know that I am the LORD their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them to their own land. Then I will leave none of them captive any more.


## Ezekiel 39:29 (id: 1826039029)

29I won’t hide my face from them any more, for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel,’ says the Lord GOD.”


## Ezekiel 40:1 (id: 1826040001)

1In the twenty\-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck, in the same day, the LORD’s hand was on me, and he brought me there.


## Ezekiel 40:2 (id: 1826040002)

2In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was something like the frame of a city to the south.


## Ezekiel 40:3 (id: 1826040003)

3He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.


## Ezekiel 40:4 (id: 1826040004)

4The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for you have been brought here so that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”


## Ezekiel 40:5 (id: 1826040005)

5Behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand width each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.


## Ezekiel 40:6 (id: 1826040006)

6Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide.


## Ezekiel 40:7 (id: 1826040007)

7Every lodge was one reed long and one reed wide. Between the lodges was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.


## Ezekiel 40:8 (id: 1826040008)

8He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.


## Ezekiel 40:9 (id: 1826040009)

9Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.


## Ezekiel 40:10 (id: 1826040010)

10The side rooms of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure. The posts had one measure on this side and on that side.


## Ezekiel 40:11 (id: 1826040011)

11He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;


## Ezekiel 40:12 (id: 1826040012)

12and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the side rooms, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.


## Ezekiel 40:13 (id: 1826040013)

13He measured the gate from the roof of the one side room to the roof of the other, a width of twenty\-five cubits, door against door.


## Ezekiel 40:14 (id: 1826040014)

14He also made posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate.


## Ezekiel 40:15 (id: 1826040015)

15From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.


## Ezekiel 40:16 (id: 1826040016)

16There were closed windows to the side rooms, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches. Windows were around inward. Palm trees were on each post.


## Ezekiel 40:17 (id: 1826040017)

17Then he brought me into the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and a pavement made for the court all around. Thirty rooms were on the pavement.


## Ezekiel 40:18 (id: 1826040018)

18The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.


## Ezekiel 40:19 (id: 1826040019)

19Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.


## Ezekiel 40:20 (id: 1826040020)

20He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces toward the north.


## Ezekiel 40:21 (id: 1826040021)

21The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side. Its posts and its arches were the same as the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty\-five cubits.


## Ezekiel 40:22 (id: 1826040022)

22Its windows, its arches, and its palm trees were the same as the measure of the gate which faces toward the east. They went up to it by seven steps. Its arches were before them.


## Ezekiel 40:23 (id: 1826040023)

23There was a gate to the inner court facing the other gate, on the north and on the east. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate.


## Ezekiel 40:24 (id: 1826040024)

24He led me toward the south; and behold, there was a gate toward the south. He measured its posts and its arches according to these measurements.


## Ezekiel 40:25 (id: 1826040025)

25There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like the other windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty\-five cubits.


## Ezekiel 40:26 (id: 1826040026)

26There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them. It had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts.

29with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty\-five cubits wide.

32He brought me into the inner court toward the east. He measured the gate according to these measurements;


## Ezekiel 40:33 (id: 1826040033)

33with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty\-five cubits wide.


## Ezekiel 40:34 (id: 1826040034)

34Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps.


## Ezekiel 40:35 (id: 1826040035)

35He brought me to the north gate, and he measured it according to these measurements—


## Ezekiel 40:36 (id: 1826040036)

36its lodges, its posts, and its arches. There were windows in it all around. The length was fifty cubits and the width twenty\-five cubits.


## Ezekiel 40:37 (id: 1826040037)

37Its posts were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps.


## Ezekiel 40:38 (id: 1826040038)

38A room with its door was by the posts at the gates. They washed the burnt offering there.


## Ezekiel 40:39 (id: 1826040039)

39In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to kill the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.


## Ezekiel 40:40 (id: 1826040040)

40On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.


## Ezekiel 40:41 (id: 1826040041)

41Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate: eight tables, on which they killed the sacrifices.


## Ezekiel 40:42 (id: 1826040042)

42There were four cut stone tables for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. They laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice on them.


## Ezekiel 40:43 (id: 1826040043)

43The hooks, a hand width long, were fastened within all around. The meat of the offering was on the tables.


## Ezekiel 40:44 (id: 1826040044)

44Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate. They faced toward the south. One at the side of the east gate faced toward the north.


## Ezekiel 40:45 (id: 1826040045)

45He said to me, “This room, which faces toward the south, is for the priests who perform the duty of the house.


## Ezekiel 40:46 (id: 1826040046)

46The room which faces toward the north is for the priests who perform the duty of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to the LORD to minister to him.”


## Ezekiel 40:47 (id: 1826040047)

47He measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, square. The altar was before the house.


## Ezekiel 40:48 (id: 1826040048)

48Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.


## Ezekiel 40:49 (id: 1826040049)

49The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits, even by the steps by which they went up to it. There were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.


## Ezekiel 41:1 (id: 1826041001)

1He brought me to the nave and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tent.


## Ezekiel 41:2 (id: 1826041002)

2The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.


## Ezekiel 41:3 (id: 1826041003)

3Then he went inward and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.


## Ezekiel 41:4 (id: 1826041004)

4He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the nave. He said to me, “This is the most holy place.”


## Ezekiel 41:5 (id: 1826041005)

5Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side.


## Ezekiel 41:6 (id: 1826041006)

6The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in each story. They entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported and not penetrate the wall of the house.


## Ezekiel 41:7 (id: 1826041007)

7The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the width of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.


## Ezekiel 41:8 (id: 1826041008)

8I saw also that the house had a raised base all around. The foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits.


## Ezekiel 41:9 (id: 1826041009)

9The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits. That which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house.


## Ezekiel 41:10 (id: 1826041010)

10Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side.


## Ezekiel 41:11 (id: 1826041011)

11The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around.


## Ezekiel 41:12 (id: 1826041012)

12The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.


## Ezekiel 41:13 (id: 1826041013)

13So he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long;


## Ezekiel 41:14 (id: 1826041014)

14also the width of the face of the temple, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits.


## Ezekiel 41:15 (id: 1826041015)

15He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits from the inner temple, and the porches of the court,


## Ezekiel 41:16 (id: 1826041016)

16the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, opposite the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),


## Ezekiel 41:17 (id: 1826041017)

17to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure.


## Ezekiel 41:18 (id: 1826041018)

18It was made with cherubim and palm trees. A palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces,


## Ezekiel 41:19 (id: 1826041019)

19so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. It was made like this through all the house all around.


## Ezekiel 41:20 (id: 1826041020)

20Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. The wall of the temple was like this.


## Ezekiel 41:21 (id: 1826041021)

21The door posts of the nave were squared. As for the face of the nave, its appearance was as the appearance of the temple.


## Ezekiel 41:22 (id: 1826041022)

22The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before the LORD.”


## Ezekiel 41:23 (id: 1826041023)

23The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.


## Ezekiel 41:24 (id: 1826041024)

24The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.


## Ezekiel 41:25 (id: 1826041025)

25There were made on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees, like those made on the walls. There was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.


## Ezekiel 41:26 (id: 1826041026)

26There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch. This is how the side rooms of the temple and the thresholds were arranged.


## Ezekiel 42:1 (id: 1826042001)

1Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north. Then he brought me into the room that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north.


## Ezekiel 42:2 (id: 1826042002)

2Facing the length of one hundred cubits was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits.


## Ezekiel 42:3 (id: 1826042003)

3Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the three stories.


## Ezekiel 42:4 (id: 1826042004)

4Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.


## Ezekiel 42:5 (id: 1826042005)

5Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these more than from the lower and the middle in the building.


## Ezekiel 42:6 (id: 1826042006)

6For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground.


## Ezekiel 42:7 (id: 1826042007)

7The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, was fifty cubits long.


## Ezekiel 42:8 (id: 1826042008)

8For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits. Behold, those facing the temple were one hundred cubits.


## Ezekiel 42:9 (id: 1826042009)

9From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.


## Ezekiel 42:10 (id: 1826042010)

10In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were rooms.


## Ezekiel 42:11 (id: 1826042011)

11The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were toward the north. Their length and width were the same. All their exits had the same arrangement and doors.


## Ezekiel 42:12 (id: 1826042012)

12Like the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.


## Ezekiel 42:13 (id: 1826042013)

13Then he said to me, “The north rooms and the south rooms, which are opposite the separate place, are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to the LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, with the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.


## Ezekiel 42:14 (id: 1826042014)

14When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court until they lay their garments in which they minister there; for they are holy. Then they shall put on other garments, and shall approach that which is for the people.”


## Ezekiel 42:15 (id: 1826042015)

15Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faces toward the east, and measured it all around.


## Ezekiel 42:16 (id: 1826042016)

16He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around.


## Ezekiel 42:17 (id: 1826042017)

17He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around.


## Ezekiel 42:18 (id: 1826042018)

18He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.


## Ezekiel 42:19 (id: 1826042019)

19He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.


## Ezekiel 42:20 (id: 1826042020)

20He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, the length five hundred cubits, and the width five hundred cubits, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.


## Ezekiel 43:1 (id: 1826043001)

1Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east.


## Ezekiel 43:2 (id: 1826043002)

2Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth was illuminated with his glory.


## Ezekiel 43:3 (id: 1826043003)

3It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.


## Ezekiel 43:4 (id: 1826043004)

4The LORD’s glory came into the house by the way of the gate which faces toward the east.


## Ezekiel 43:5 (id: 1826043005)

5The Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the LORD’s glory filled the house.


## Ezekiel 43:6 (id: 1826043006)

6I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and a man stood by me.


## Ezekiel 43:7 (id: 1826043007)

7He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their prostitution and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places;


## Ezekiel 43:8 (id: 1826043008)

8in their setting of their threshold by my threshold and their door post beside my door post. There was a wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them in my anger.


## Ezekiel 43:9 (id: 1826043009)

9Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings far from me. Then I will dwell among them forever.


## Ezekiel 43:10 (id: 1826043010)

10“You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.


## Ezekiel 43:11 (id: 1826043011)

11If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, its fashion, its exits, its entrances, its structure, all its ordinances, all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.


## Ezekiel 43:12 (id: 1826043012)

12“This is the law of the house. On the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.


## Ezekiel 43:13 (id: 1826043013)

13“These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a hand width): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the width a cubit, and its border around its edge a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.


## Ezekiel 43:14 (id: 1826043014)

14From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the width a cubit.


## Ezekiel 43:15 (id: 1826043015)

15The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.


## Ezekiel 43:16 (id: 1826043016)

16The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides.


## Ezekiel 43:17 (id: 1826043017)

17The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit around; and its steps shall look toward the east.”


## Ezekiel 43:18 (id: 1826043018)
