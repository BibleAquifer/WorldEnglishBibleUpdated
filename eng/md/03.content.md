## Leviticus 10:14 (id: 1803010014)

## Leviticus 10:17 (id: 1803010017)

17“Why haven’t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?


## Leviticus 10:18 (id: 1803010018)

18Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.”


## Leviticus 10:19 (id: 1803010019)

17If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.

## Leviticus 27:19 (id: 1803027019)

19If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his.

20If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;

## Leviticus 27:28 (id: 1803027028)

28“‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Everything that is permanently devoted is most holy to the LORD.

## Leviticus 27:31 (id: 1803027031)

31If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it.


## Leviticus 27:32 (id: 1803027032)

32All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.


## Leviticus 27:33 (id: 1803027033)

33He shall not examine whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange it. If he exchanges it at all, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.’”
