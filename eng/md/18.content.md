## Job 1:1 (id: 1818001001)

1There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.


## Job 1:2 (id: 1818001002)

2There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.


## Job 1:3 (id: 1818001003)

3His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.


## Job 1:4 (id: 1818001004)

4His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.


## Job 1:5 (id: 1818001005)

5It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.


## Job 1:6 (id: 1818001006)

6Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before the LORD, Satan also came among them.


## Job 1:7 (id: 1818001007)

7The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”


## Job 1:8 (id: 1818001008)

8The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”


## Job 1:9 (id: 1818001009)

9Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?


## Job 1:10 (id: 1818001010)

10Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.


## Job 1:11 (id: 1818001011)

11But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”


## Job 1:12 (id: 1818001012)

12The LORD said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.” So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.


## Job 1:13 (id: 1818001013)

13It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,


## Job 1:14 (id: 1818001014)

14that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,


## Job 1:15 (id: 1818001015)

15and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”


## Job 1:16 (id: 1818001016)

16While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”


## Job 1:17 (id: 1818001017)

17While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”


## Job 1:18 (id: 1818001018)

18While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,


## Job 1:19 (id: 1818001019)

19and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”


## Job 1:20 (id: 1818001020)

20Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.


## Job 1:21 (id: 1818001021)

21He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the LORD’s name.”


## Job 1:22 (id: 1818001022)

22In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.


## Job 2:1 (id: 1818002001)

1Again, on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before the LORD, Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.


## Job 2:2 (id: 1818002002)

2The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”


## Job 2:3 (id: 1818002003)

3The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”


## Job 2:4 (id: 1818002004)

4Satan answered the LORD, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.


## Job 2:5 (id: 1818002005)

5But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”


## Job 2:6 (id: 1818002006)

6The LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”


## Job 2:7 (id: 1818002007)

7So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.


## Job 2:8 (id: 1818002008)

8He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.


## Job 2:9 (id: 1818002009)

9Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”


## Job 2:10 (id: 1818002010)

10But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.


## Job 2:11 (id: 1818002011)

11Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.


## Job 2:12 (id: 1818002012)

12When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.


## Job 2:13 (id: 1818002013)

13So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.


## Job 3:1 (id: 1818003001)

1After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.


## Job 3:2 (id: 1818003002)

2Job answered:


## Job 3:3 (id: 1818003003)

3“Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’


## Job 3:4 (id: 1818003004)

4Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it.


## Job 3:5 (id: 1818003005)

5Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes the day black terrify it.


## Job 3:6 (id: 1818003006)

6As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.


## Job 3:7 (id: 1818003007)

7Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein.


## Job 3:8 (id: 1818003008)

8Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.


## Job 3:9 (id: 1818003009)

9Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,


## Job 3:10 (id: 1818003010)

10because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.


## Job 3:11 (id: 1818003011)

11“Why didn’t I die from the womb? Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?


## Job 3:12 (id: 1818003012)

12Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should nurse?


## Job 3:13 (id: 1818003013)

13For now I should have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,


## Job 3:14 (id: 1818003014)

14with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves;


## Job 3:15 (id: 1818003015)

15or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver;


## Job 3:16 (id: 1818003016)

16or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants who never saw light.


## Job 3:17 (id: 1818003017)

17There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest.


## Job 3:18 (id: 1818003018)

18There the prisoners are at ease together. They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.


## Job 3:19 (id: 1818003019)

19The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master.


## Job 3:20 (id: 1818003020)

20“Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the bitter in soul,


## Job 3:21 (id: 1818003021)

21who long for death, but it doesn’t come; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,


## Job 3:22 (id: 1818003022)

22who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?


## Job 3:23 (id: 1818003023)

23Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?


## Job 3:24 (id: 1818003024)

24For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water.


## Job 3:25 (id: 1818003025)

25For the thing which I fear comes on me, that which I am afraid of comes to me.


## Job 3:26 (id: 1818003026)

26I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest; but trouble comes.”


## Job 4:1 (id: 1818004001)

1Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,


## Job 4:2 (id: 1818004002)

2“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?


## Job 4:3 (id: 1818004003)

3Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened the weak hands.


## Job 4:4 (id: 1818004004)

4Your words have supported him who was falling, you have made the feeble knees firm.


## Job 4:5 (id: 1818004005)

5But now it has come to you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled.


## Job 4:6 (id: 1818004006)

6Isn’t your piety your confidence? Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?


## Job 4:7 (id: 1818004007)

7“Remember, now, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?


## Job 4:8 (id: 1818004008)

8According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble, reap the same.


## Job 4:9 (id: 1818004009)

9By the breath of God they perish. By the blast of his anger are they consumed.


## Job 4:10 (id: 1818004010)

10The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken.


## Job 4:11 (id: 1818004011)

11The old lion perishes for lack of prey. The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.


## Job 4:12 (id: 1818004012)

12“Now a thing was secretly brought to me. My ear received a whisper of it.


## Job 4:13 (id: 1818004013)

13In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,


## Job 4:14 (id: 1818004014)

14fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.


## Job 4:15 (id: 1818004015)

15Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up.


## Job 4:16 (id: 1818004016)

16It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,


## Job 4:17 (id: 1818004017)

17‘Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?


## Job 4:18 (id: 1818004018)

18Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. He charges his angels with error.


## Job 4:19 (id: 1818004019)

19How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!


## Job 4:20 (id: 1818004020)

20Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it.


## Job 4:21 (id: 1818004021)

21Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.’


## Job 5:1 (id: 1818005001)

1“Call now; is there any who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?


## Job 5:2 (id: 1818005002)

2For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple.


## Job 5:3 (id: 1818005003)

3I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation.


## Job 5:4 (id: 1818005004)

4His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,


## Job 5:5 (id: 1818005005)

5whose harvest the hungry eat up, and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance.


## Job 5:6 (id: 1818005006)

6For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;


## Job 5:7 (id: 1818005007)

7but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.


## Job 5:8 (id: 1818005008)

8“But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God,


## Job 5:9 (id: 1818005009)

9who does great things that can’t be fathomed, marvelous things without number;


## Job 5:10 (id: 1818005010)

10who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields;


## Job 5:11 (id: 1818005011)

11so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn are exalted to safety.


## Job 5:12 (id: 1818005012)

12He frustrates the plans of the crafty, so that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.


## Job 5:13 (id: 1818005013)

13He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.


## Job 5:14 (id: 1818005014)

14They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday as in the night.


## Job 5:15 (id: 1818005015)

15But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.


## Job 5:16 (id: 1818005016)

16So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.


## Job 5:17 (id: 1818005017)

17“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.


## Job 5:18 (id: 1818005018)

18For he wounds and binds up. He injures and his hands make whole.


## Job 5:19 (id: 1818005019)

19He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven no evil will touch you.


## Job 5:20 (id: 1818005020)

20In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power of the sword.


## Job 5:21 (id: 1818005021)

21You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes.


## Job 5:22 (id: 1818005022)

22You will laugh at destruction and famine, neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth.


## Job 5:23 (id: 1818005023)

23For you will be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field will be at peace with you.


## Job 5:24 (id: 1818005024)

24You will know that your tent is in peace. You will visit your fold, and will miss nothing.


## Job 5:25 (id: 1818005025)

25You will know also that your offspring will be great, your offspring as the grass of the earth.


## Job 5:26 (id: 1818005026)

26You will come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season.


## Job 5:27 (id: 1818005027)

27Behold, we have researched it. It is so. Hear it, and know it for your good.”


## Job 6:1 (id: 1818006001)

1Then Job answered,


## Job 6:2 (id: 1818006002)

2“Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!


## Job 6:3 (id: 1818006003)

3For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas, therefore my words have been rash.


## Job 6:4 (id: 1818006004)

4For the arrows of the Almighty are within me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.


## Job 6:5 (id: 1818006005)

5Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?


## Job 6:6 (id: 1818006006)

6Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?


## Job 6:7 (id: 1818006007)

7My soul refuses to touch them. They are as loathsome food to me.


## Job 6:8 (id: 1818006008)

8“Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing that I long for,


## Job 6:9 (id: 1818006009)

9even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!


## Job 6:10 (id: 1818006010)

10Let it still be my consolation, yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.


## Job 6:11 (id: 1818006011)

11What is my strength, that I should wait? What is my end, that I should be patient?


## Job 6:12 (id: 1818006012)

12Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of bronze?


## Job 6:13 (id: 1818006013)

13Isn’t it that I have no help in me, that wisdom is driven away from me?


## Job 6:14 (id: 1818006014)

14“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.


## Job 6:15 (id: 1818006015)

15My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away;


## Job 6:16 (id: 1818006016)

16which are black by reason of the ice, in which the snow hides itself.


## Job 6:17 (id: 1818006017)

17In the dry season, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.


## Job 6:18 (id: 1818006018)

18The caravans that travel beside them turn away. They go up into the waste, and perish.


## Job 6:19 (id: 1818006019)

19The caravans of Tema looked. The companies of Sheba waited for them.


## Job 6:20 (id: 1818006020)

20They were distressed because they were confident. They came there, and were confounded.


## Job 6:21 (id: 1818006021)

21For now you are nothing. You see a terror, and are afraid.


## Job 6:22 (id: 1818006022)

22Did I ever say, ‘Give to me’? or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance’?


## Job 6:23 (id: 1818006023)

23or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’? or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’?


## Job 6:24 (id: 1818006024)

24“Teach me, and I will hold my peace. Cause me to understand my error.


## Job 6:25 (id: 1818006025)

25How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove?


## Job 6:26 (id: 1818006026)

26Do you intend to reprove words, since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?


## Job 6:27 (id: 1818006027)

27Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend.


## Job 6:28 (id: 1818006028)

28Now therefore be pleased to look at me, for surely I will not lie to your face.


## Job 6:29 (id: 1818006029)

29Please return. Let there be no injustice. Yes, return again. My cause is righteous.


## Job 6:30 (id: 1818006030)

30Is there injustice on my tongue? Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?


## Job 7:1 (id: 1818007001)

1“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth? Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?


## Job 7:2 (id: 1818007002)

2As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages,


## Job 7:3 (id: 1818007003)

3so I am made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me.


## Job 7:4 (id: 1818007004)

4When I lie down, I say, ‘When will I arise, and the night be gone?’ I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.


## Job 7:5 (id: 1818007005)

5My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.


## Job 7:6 (id: 1818007006)

6My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.


## Job 7:7 (id: 1818007007)

7Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye will no more see good.


## Job 7:8 (id: 1818007008)

8The eye of him who sees me will see me no more. Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.


## Job 7:9 (id: 1818007009)

9As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more.


## Job 7:10 (id: 1818007010)

10He will return no more to his house, neither will his place know him any more.


## Job 7:11 (id: 1818007011)

11“Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.


## Job 7:12 (id: 1818007012)

12Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me?


## Job 7:13 (id: 1818007013)

13When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me. My couch will ease my complaint,’


## Job 7:14 (id: 1818007014)

14then you scare me with dreams and terrify me through visions,


## Job 7:15 (id: 1818007015)

15so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones.


## Job 7:16 (id: 1818007016)

16I loathe my life. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.


## Job 7:17 (id: 1818007017)

17What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him,


## Job 7:18 (id: 1818007018)

18that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?

16If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.

17For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause.

20Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me. Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse.

11You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.

12You have granted me life and loving kindness. Your visitation has preserved my spirit.

14if I sin, then you mark me. You will not acquit me from my iniquity.


## Job 10:15 (id: 1818010015)

15If I am wicked, woe to me. If I am righteous, I still will not lift up my head, being filled with disgrace, and conscious of my affliction.

## Job 11:1 (id: 1818011001)

2“Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified?

3Should your boastings make men hold their peace? When you mock, will no man make you ashamed?

4For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure. I am clean in your eyes.’


## Job 11:5 (id: 1818011005)

5But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you,

9Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.

10If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?

11For he knows false men. He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it.

12An empty\-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt.

13“If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him.

14If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away. Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.

15Surely then you will lift up your face without spot. Yes, you will be steadfast, and will not fear,

19Also you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid. Yes, many will court your favor.

20But the eyes of the wicked will fail. They will have no way to flee. Their hope will be the giving up of the spirit.”


## Job 12:1 (id: 1818012001)

1Then Job answered,


## Job 12:2 (id: 1818012002)

2“No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom will die with you.


## Job 12:3 (id: 1818012003)

3But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these?


## Job 12:4 (id: 1818012004)

4I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke.


## Job 12:5 (id: 1818012005)

5In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips.

6The tents of robbers prosper. Those who provoke God are secure, who carry their god in their hands.

7“But ask the animals now, and they will teach you; the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.

8Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you. The fish of the sea will declare to you.


## Job 12:9 (id: 1818012009)

9Who doesn’t know that in all these, the LORD’s hand has done this,


## Job 12:10 (id: 1818012010)

10in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind?


## Job 12:11 (id: 1818012011)

11Doesn’t the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food?

12With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding.


## Job 12:13 (id: 1818012013)

13“With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding.

15Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.

19He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty.


## Job 12:20 (id: 1818012020)

20He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders.

21He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong.

22He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death.


## Job 12:23 (id: 1818012023)

23He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.

24He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.


## Job 12:25 (id: 1818012025)

25They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.

7Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?

8Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God?


## Job 13:9 (id: 1818013009)

9Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?

10He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality.

11Won’t his majesty make you afraid and his dread fall on you?


## Job 13:12 (id: 1818013012)

12Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes. Your defenses are defenses of clay.

10But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?

11As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up,

14If a man dies, will he live again? I would wait all the days of my warfare, until my release should come.


## Job 14:15 (id: 1818014015)

15You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire for the work of your hands.


## Job 14:16 (id: 1818014016)

16But now you count my steps. Don’t you watch over my sin?


## Job 14:17 (id: 1818014017)

17My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity.


## Job 14:18 (id: 1818014018)

18“But the mountain falling comes to nothing. The rock is removed out of its place.


## Job 14:19 (id: 1818014019)

19The waters wear the stones. The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope of man.


## Job 14:20 (id: 1818014020)

20You forever prevail against him, and he departs. You change his face, and send him away.


## Job 14:21 (id: 1818014021)

21His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it. They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them.


## Job 14:22 (id: 1818014022)

22But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns.”


## Job 15:1 (id: 1818015001)

1Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,


## Job 15:2 (id: 1818015002)

2“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind?


## Job 15:3 (id: 1818015003)

3Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches with which he can do no good?


## Job 15:4 (id: 1818015004)

4Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God.


## Job 15:5 (id: 1818015005)

5For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.


## Job 15:6 (id: 1818015006)

6Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips testify against you.


## Job 15:7 (id: 1818015007)

7“Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought out before the hills?


## Job 15:8 (id: 1818015008)

8Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?


## Job 15:9 (id: 1818015009)

9What do you know that we don’t know? What do you understand which is not in us?


## Job 15:10 (id: 1818015010)

10With us are both the gray\-headed and the very aged men, much older than your father.


## Job 15:11 (id: 1818015011)

11Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you?


## Job 15:12 (id: 1818015012)

12Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,


## Job 15:13 (id: 1818015013)

13that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?


## Job 15:14 (id: 1818015014)

14What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?


## Job 15:15 (id: 1818015015)

15Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;


## Job 15:16 (id: 1818015016)

16how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!


## Job 15:17 (id: 1818015017)

17“I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare


## Job 15:18 (id: 1818015018)

18(which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;


## Job 15:19 (id: 1818015019)

19to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):


## Job 15:20 (id: 1818015020)

20the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.


## Job 15:21 (id: 1818015021)

21A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer will come on him.


## Job 15:22 (id: 1818015022)

22He doesn’t believe that he will return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword.


## Job 15:23 (id: 1818015023)

23He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.


## Job 15:24 (id: 1818015024)

24Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.


## Job 15:25 (id: 1818015025)

25Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty,


## Job 15:26 (id: 1818015026)

26he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers,


## Job 15:27 (id: 1818015027)

27because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs.


## Job 15:28 (id: 1818015028)

28He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps.


## Job 15:29 (id: 1818015029)

29He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue, neither will their possessions be extended on the earth.


## Job 15:30 (id: 1818015030)

30He will not depart out of darkness. The flame will dry up his branches. He will go away by the breath of God’s mouth.


## Job 15:31 (id: 1818015031)

31Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his reward.


## Job 15:32 (id: 1818015032)

32It will be accomplished before his time. His branch will not be green.


## Job 15:33 (id: 1818015033)

33He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and will cast off his flower as the olive tree.


## Job 15:34 (id: 1818015034)

34For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.


## Job 15:35 (id: 1818015035)

35They conceive mischief and produce iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit.”


## Job 16:1 (id: 1818016001)

1Then Job answered,


## Job 16:2 (id: 1818016002)

2“I have heard many such things. You are all miserable comforters!


## Job 16:3 (id: 1818016003)

3Shall vain words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?


## Job 16:4 (id: 1818016004)

4I also could speak as you do. If your soul were in my soul’s place, I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you,


## Job 16:5 (id: 1818016005)

5but I would strengthen you with my mouth. The solace of my lips would relieve you.


## Job 16:6 (id: 1818016006)

6“Though I speak, my grief is not subsided. Though I forbear, what am I eased?


## Job 16:7 (id: 1818016007)

7But now, God, you have surely worn me out. You have made all my company desolate.


## Job 16:8 (id: 1818016008)

8You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me. My leanness rises up against me. It testifies to my face.


## Job 16:9 (id: 1818016009)

9He has torn me in his wrath and persecuted me. He has gnashed on me with his teeth. My adversary sharpens his eyes on me.


## Job 16:10 (id: 1818016010)

10They have gaped on me with their mouth. They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves together against me.


## Job 16:11 (id: 1818016011)

11God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked.


## Job 16:12 (id: 1818016012)

12I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his target.


## Job 16:13 (id: 1818016013)

13His archers surround me. He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare. He pours out my bile on the ground.


## Job 16:14 (id: 1818016014)

14He breaks me with breach on breach. He runs at me like a giant.


## Job 16:15 (id: 1818016015)

15I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn in the dust.


## Job 16:16 (id: 1818016016)

16My face is red with weeping. Deep darkness is on my eyelids,


## Job 16:17 (id: 1818016017)

17although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.


## Job 16:18 (id: 1818016018)

18“Earth, don’t cover my blood. Let my cry have no place to rest.


## Job 16:19 (id: 1818016019)

19Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven. He who vouches for me is on high.


## Job 16:20 (id: 1818016020)

20My friends scoff at me. My eyes pour out tears to God,


## Job 16:21 (id: 1818016021)

21that he would maintain the right of a man with God, of a son of man with his neighbor!


## Job 16:22 (id: 1818016022)

22For when a few years have come, I will go the way of no return.


## Job 17:1 (id: 1818017001)

1“My spirit is consumed. My days are extinct and the grave is ready for me.


## Job 17:2 (id: 1818017002)

2Surely there are mockers with me. My eye dwells on their provocation.


## Job 17:3 (id: 1818017003)

3“Now give a pledge. Be collateral for me with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me?


## Job 17:4 (id: 1818017004)

4For you have hidden their heart from understanding, therefore you will not exalt them.


## Job 17:5 (id: 1818017005)

5He who denounces his friends for plunder, even the eyes of his children will fail.


## Job 17:6 (id: 1818017006)

6“But he has made me a byword of the people. They spit in my face.


## Job 17:7 (id: 1818017007)

7My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. All my members are as a shadow.


## Job 17:8 (id: 1818017008)

8Upright men will be astonished at this. The innocent will stir himself up against the godless.


## Job 17:9 (id: 1818017009)

9Yet the righteous will hold to his way. He who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger.


## Job 17:10 (id: 1818017010)

10But as for you all, come back. I will not find a wise man among you.


## Job 17:11 (id: 1818017011)

11My days are past. My plans are broken off, as are the thoughts of my heart.


## Job 17:12 (id: 1818017012)

12They change the night into day, saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness.


## Job 17:13 (id: 1818017013)

13If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch in the darkness,


## Job 17:14 (id: 1818017014)

14if I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘My sister,’


## Job 17:15 (id: 1818017015)

15where then is my hope? As for my hope, who will see it?


## Job 17:16 (id: 1818017016)

16Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?”


## Job 18:1 (id: 1818018001)

1Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,


## Job 18:2 (id: 1818018002)

2“How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.


## Job 18:3 (id: 1818018003)

3Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean in your sight?


## Job 18:4 (id: 1818018004)

4You who tear yourself in your anger, will the earth be forsaken for you? Or will the rock be removed out of its place?


## Job 18:5 (id: 1818018005)

5“Yes, the light of the wicked will be put out. The spark of his fire won’t shine.


## Job 18:6 (id: 1818018006)

6The light will be dark in his tent. His lamp above him will be put out.


## Job 18:7 (id: 1818018007)

7The steps of his strength will be shortened. His own counsel will cast him down.


## Job 18:8 (id: 1818018008)

8For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders into its mesh.


## Job 18:9 (id: 1818018009)

9A snare will take him by the heel. A trap will catch him.


## Job 18:10 (id: 1818018010)

10A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him on the path.


## Job 18:11 (id: 1818018011)

11Terrors will make him afraid on every side, and will chase him at his heels.


## Job 18:12 (id: 1818018012)

12His strength will be famished. Calamity will be ready at his side.


## Job 18:13 (id: 1818018013)

13The members of his body will be devoured. The firstborn of death will devour his members.


## Job 18:14 (id: 1818018014)

14He will be rooted out of the security of his tent. He will be brought to the king of terrors.


## Job 18:15 (id: 1818018015)

15There will dwell in his tent that which is none of his. Sulfur will be scattered on his habitation.


## Job 18:16 (id: 1818018016)

16His roots will be dried up beneath. His branch will be cut off above.


## Job 18:17 (id: 1818018017)

17His memory will perish from the earth. He will have no name in the street.


## Job 18:18 (id: 1818018018)

18He will be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.


## Job 18:19 (id: 1818018019)

19He will have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he lived.


## Job 18:20 (id: 1818018020)

20Those who come after will be astonished at his day, as those who went before were frightened.


## Job 18:21 (id: 1818018021)

21Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous. This is the place of him who doesn’t know God.”


## Job 19:1 (id: 1818019001)

1Then Job answered,


## Job 19:2 (id: 1818019002)

2“How long will you torment me, and crush me with words?


## Job 19:3 (id: 1818019003)

3You have reproached me ten times. You aren’t ashamed that you attack me.


## Job 19:4 (id: 1818019004)

4If it is true that I have erred, my error remains with myself.


## Job 19:5 (id: 1818019005)

5If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach,


## Job 19:6 (id: 1818019006)

6know now that God has subverted me, and has surrounded me with his net.


## Job 19:7 (id: 1818019007)

7“Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry for help, but there is no justice.


## Job 19:8 (id: 1818019008)

8He has walled up my way so that I can’t pass, and has set darkness in my paths.


## Job 19:9 (id: 1818019009)

9He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.


## Job 19:10 (id: 1818019010)

10He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone. He has plucked my hope up like a tree.


## Job 19:11 (id: 1818019011)

11He has also kindled his wrath against me. He counts me among his adversaries.


## Job 19:12 (id: 1818019012)

12His troops come on together, build a siege ramp against me, and encamp around my tent.


## Job 19:13 (id: 1818019013)

13“He has put my brothers far from me. My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.


## Job 19:14 (id: 1818019014)

14My relatives have gone away. My familiar friends have forgotten me.


## Job 19:15 (id: 1818019015)

15Those who dwell in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. I am an alien in their sight.


## Job 19:16 (id: 1818019016)

16I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer. I beg him with my mouth.


## Job 19:17 (id: 1818019017)

17My breath is offensive to my wife. I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.


## Job 19:18 (id: 1818019018)

18Even young children despise me. If I arise, they speak against me.


## Job 19:19 (id: 1818019019)

19All my familiar friends abhor me. They whom I loved have turned against me.


## Job 19:20 (id: 1818019020)

20My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh. I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.


## Job 19:21 (id: 1818019021)

21“Have pity on me. Have pity on me, you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me.


## Job 19:22 (id: 1818019022)

22Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?


## Job 19:23 (id: 1818019023)

23“Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!


## Job 19:24 (id: 1818019024)

24That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever!


## Job 19:25 (id: 1818019025)

25But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives. In the end, he will stand upon the earth.


## Job 19:26 (id: 1818019026)

26After my skin is destroyed, then I will see God in my flesh,


## Job 19:27 (id: 1818019027)

27whom I, even I, will see on my side. My eyes will see, and not as a stranger. “My heart is consumed within me.


## Job 19:28 (id: 1818019028)

28If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’ because the root of the matter is found in me,


## Job 19:29 (id: 1818019029)

29be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.”


## Job 20:1 (id: 1818020001)

1Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,


## Job 20:2 (id: 1818020002)

2“Therefore my thoughts answer me, even by reason of my haste that is in me.


## Job 20:3 (id: 1818020003)

3I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame. The spirit of my understanding answers me.


## Job 20:4 (id: 1818020004)

4Don’t you know this from old time, since man was placed on earth,


## Job 20:5 (id: 1818020005)

5that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless but for a moment?


## Job 20:6 (id: 1818020006)

6Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,


## Job 20:7 (id: 1818020007)

7yet he will perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’


## Job 20:8 (id: 1818020008)

8He will fly away as a dream, and will not be found. Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.


## Job 20:9 (id: 1818020009)

9The eye which saw him will see him no more, neither will his place see him any more.


## Job 20:10 (id: 1818020010)

10His children will seek the favor of the poor. His hands will give back his wealth.


## Job 20:11 (id: 1818020011)

11His bones are full of his youth, but youth will lie down with him in the dust.


## Job 20:12 (id: 1818020012)

12“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue,


## Job 20:13 (id: 1818020013)

13though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth,


## Job 20:14 (id: 1818020014)

14yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is cobra venom within him.


## Job 20:15 (id: 1818020015)

15He has swallowed down riches, and he will vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly.


## Job 20:16 (id: 1818020016)

16He will suck cobra venom. The viper’s tongue will kill him.


## Job 20:17 (id: 1818020017)

17He will not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter.


## Job 20:18 (id: 1818020018)

18He will restore that for which he labored, and will not swallow it down. He will not rejoice according to the substance that he has gotten.


## Job 20:19 (id: 1818020019)

19For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he will not build it up.


## Job 20:20 (id: 1818020020)

20“Because he knew no quietness within him, he will not save anything of that in which he delights.


## Job 20:21 (id: 1818020021)

21There was nothing left that he didn’t devour, therefore his prosperity will not endure.


## Job 20:22 (id: 1818020022)

22In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress will overtake him. The hand of everyone who is in misery will come on him.


## Job 20:23 (id: 1818020023)

23When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while he is eating.


## Job 20:24 (id: 1818020024)

24He will flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow will strike him through.


## Job 20:25 (id: 1818020025)

25He draws it out, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him.


## Job 20:26 (id: 1818020026)

26All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire will devour him. It will consume that which is left in his tent.


## Job 20:27 (id: 1818020027)

27The heavens will reveal his iniquity. The earth will rise up against him.


## Job 20:28 (id: 1818020028)

28The increase of his house will depart. They will rush away in the day of his wrath.


## Job 20:29 (id: 1818020029)

29This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage appointed to him by God.”


## Job 21:1 (id: 1818021001)

1Then Job answered,


## Job 21:2 (id: 1818021002)

2“Listen diligently to my speech. Let this be your consolation.


## Job 21:3 (id: 1818021003)

3Allow me, and I also will speak. After I have spoken, mock on.


## Job 21:4 (id: 1818021004)

4As for me, is my complaint to man? Why shouldn’t I be impatient?


## Job 21:5 (id: 1818021005)

5Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth.


## Job 21:6 (id: 1818021006)

6When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh.

14For he performs that which is appointed for me. Many such things are with him.

15Therefore I am terrified at his presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him.

22Yet God preserves the mighty by his power. He rises up who has no assurance of life.

23God gives them security, and they rest in it. His eyes are on their ways.


## Job 24:24 (id: 1818024024)

26When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder,


## Job 28:27 (id: 1818028027)

27then he saw it, and declared it. He established it, yes, and searched it out.


## Job 28:28 (id: 1818028028)

28To man he said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom. To depart from evil is understanding.’”


## Job 29:1 (id: 1818029001)

1Job again took up his parable, and said,


## Job 29:2 (id: 1818029002)

2“Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;


## Job 29:3 (id: 1818029003)

3when his lamp shone on my head, and by his light I walked through darkness,


## Job 29:4 (id: 1818029004)

4as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was in my tent,


## Job 29:5 (id: 1818029005)

5when the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were around me,


## Job 29:6 (id: 1818029006)

6when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out streams of oil for me,


## Job 29:7 (id: 1818029007)

7when I went out to the city gate, when I prepared my seat in the street.


## Job 29:8 (id: 1818029008)

8The young men saw me and hid themselves. The aged rose up and stood.


## Job 29:9 (id: 1818029009)

9The princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.


## Job 29:10 (id: 1818029010)

10The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.


## Job 29:11 (id: 1818029011)

11For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me, it commended me,


## Job 29:12 (id: 1818029012)

12because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him,


## Job 29:13 (id: 1818029013)

13the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.


## Job 29:14 (id: 1818029014)

14I put on righteousness, and it clothed me. My justice was as a robe and a diadem.


## Job 29:15 (id: 1818029015)

15I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.


## Job 29:16 (id: 1818029016)

16I was a father to the needy. I researched the cause of him whom I didn’t know.


## Job 29:17 (id: 1818029017)

17I broke the jaws of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth.


## Job 29:18 (id: 1818029018)

18Then I said, ‘I will die in my own house, I will count my days as the sand.


## Job 29:19 (id: 1818029019)

19My root is spread out to the waters. The dew lies all night on my branch.

20My glory is fresh in me. My bow is renewed in my hand.’

21“Men listened to me, waited, and kept silence for my counsel.


## Job 29:22 (id: 1818029022)

22After my words they didn’t speak again. My speech fell on them.


## Job 29:23 (id: 1818029023)

23They waited for me as for the rain. Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.


## Job 29:24 (id: 1818029024)

24I smiled on them when they had no confidence. They didn’t reject the light of my face.


## Job 29:25 (id: 1818029025)

25I chose out their way, and sat as chief. I lived as a king in the army, as one who comforts the mourners.

1“But now those who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I considered unworthy to put with my sheep dogs.

2Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, men in whom ripe age has perished?

3They are gaunt from lack and famine. They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.


## Job 30:4 (id: 1818030004)

4They pluck salt herbs by the bushes. The roots of the broom tree are their food.


## Job 30:5 (id: 1818030005)

5They are driven out from among men. They cry after them as after a thief,


## Job 30:6 (id: 1818030006)

6so that they live in frightful valleys, and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.


## Job 30:7 (id: 1818030007)

7They bray among the bushes. They are gathered together under the nettles.


## Job 30:8 (id: 1818030008)

8They are children of fools, yes, children of wicked men. They were flogged out of the land.


## Job 30:9 (id: 1818030009)

9“Now I have become their song. Yes, I am a byword to them.


## Job 30:10 (id: 1818030010)

10They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and don’t hesitate to spit in my face.


## Job 30:11 (id: 1818030011)

11For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; and they have thrown off restraint before me.


## Job 30:12 (id: 1818030012)

12On my right hand rise the rabble. They thrust aside my feet. They cast their ways of destruction up against me.


## Job 30:13 (id: 1818030013)

13They mar my path. They promote my destruction without anyone’s help.


## Job 30:14 (id: 1818030014)

14As through a wide breach they come. They roll themselves in amid the ruin.


## Job 30:15 (id: 1818030015)

15Terrors have turned on me. They chase my honor as the wind. My welfare has passed away as a cloud.


## Job 30:16 (id: 1818030016)

16“Now my soul is poured out within me. Days of affliction have taken hold of me.


## Job 30:17 (id: 1818030017)

17In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.


## Job 30:18 (id: 1818030018)

18My garment is disfigured by great force. It binds me about as the collar of my tunic.

19He has cast me into the mire. I have become like dust and ashes.


## Job 30:20 (id: 1818030020)

20I cry to you, and you do not answer me. I stand up, and you gaze at me.


## Job 30:21 (id: 1818030021)

21You have turned to be cruel to me. With the might of your hand you persecute me.


## Job 30:22 (id: 1818030022)

22You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it. You dissolve me in the storm.


## Job 30:23 (id: 1818030023)

23For I know that you will bring me to death, to the house appointed for all living.


## Job 30:24 (id: 1818030024)

24“However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?


## Job 30:25 (id: 1818030025)

25Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble? Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy?


## Job 30:26 (id: 1818030026)

26When I looked for good, then evil came. When I waited for light, darkness came.


## Job 30:27 (id: 1818030027)

27My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest. Days of affliction have come on me.


## Job 30:28 (id: 1818030028)

28I go mourning without the sun. I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.


## Job 30:29 (id: 1818030029)

29I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches.


## Job 30:30 (id: 1818030030)

30My skin grows black and peels from me. My bones are burned with heat.


## Job 30:31 (id: 1818030031)

31Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.


## Job 31:1 (id: 1818031001)

1“I made a covenant with my eyes; how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?


## Job 31:2 (id: 1818031002)

2For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage from the Almighty on high?


## Job 31:3 (id: 1818031003)

3Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity?


## Job 31:4 (id: 1818031004)

4Doesn’t he see my ways, and count all my steps?


## Job 31:5 (id: 1818031005)

5“If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit


## Job 31:6 (id: 1818031006)

6(let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity);


## Job 31:7 (id: 1818031007)

7if my step has turned out of the way, if my heart walked after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands,


## Job 31:8 (id: 1818031008)

8then let me sow, and let another eat. Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.


## Job 31:9 (id: 1818031009)

9“If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door,


## Job 31:10 (id: 1818031010)

10then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her.


## Job 31:11 (id: 1818031011)

11For that would be a heinous crime. Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges,


## Job 31:12 (id: 1818031012)

12for it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase.


## Job 31:13 (id: 1818031013)

13“If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant, when they contended with me,


## Job 31:14 (id: 1818031014)

14what then will I do when God rises up? When he visits, what will I answer him?


## Job 31:15 (id: 1818031015)

15Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him? Didn’t one fashion us in the womb?


## Job 31:16 (id: 1818031016)

16“If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,


## Job 31:17 (id: 1818031017)

17or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it


## Job 31:18 (id: 1818031018)

18(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, I have guided her from my mother’s womb);


## Job 31:19 (id: 1818031019)

19if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering;


## Job 31:20 (id: 1818031020)

20if his heart hasn’t blessed me, if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece;


## Job 31:21 (id: 1818031021)

21if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate;


## Job 31:22 (id: 1818031022)

22then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.


## Job 31:23 (id: 1818031023)

23For calamity from God is a terror to me. Because of his majesty, I can do nothing.


## Job 31:24 (id: 1818031024)

24“If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’


## Job 31:25 (id: 1818031025)

25If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;


## Job 31:26 (id: 1818031026)

26if I have seen the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in splendor,


## Job 31:27 (id: 1818031027)

27and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth;


## Job 31:28 (id: 1818031028)

28this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have denied the God who is above.


## Job 31:29 (id: 1818031029)

29“If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him


## Job 31:30 (id: 1818031030)

30(I have certainly not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse);


## Job 31:31 (id: 1818031031)

31if the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’


## Job 31:32 (id: 1818031032)

32(the foreigner has not camped in the street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler);


## Job 31:33 (id: 1818031033)

33if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my heart,


## Job 31:34 (id: 1818031034)

34because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door—


## Job 31:35 (id: 1818031035)

35oh that I had one to hear me! Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me! Let the accuser write my indictment!


## Job 31:36 (id: 1818031036)

36Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, and I would bind it to me as a crown.


## Job 31:37 (id: 1818031037)

37I would declare to him the number of my steps. I would go near to him like a prince.


## Job 31:38 (id: 1818031038)

38If my land cries out against me, and its furrows weep together;


## Job 31:39 (id: 1818031039)

39if I have eaten its fruits without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life,


## Job 31:40 (id: 1818031040)

40let briers grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended.


## Job 32:1 (id: 1818032001)

1So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.


## Job 32:2 (id: 1818032002)

2Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.


## Job 32:3 (id: 1818032003)

3Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.


## Job 32:4 (id: 1818032004)

4Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.


## Job 32:5 (id: 1818032005)

5When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.


## Job 32:6 (id: 1818032006)

6Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, “I am young, and you are very old. Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.


## Job 32:7 (id: 1818032007)

7I said, ‘Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’


## Job 32:8 (id: 1818032008)

8But there is a spirit in man, and the Spirit of the Almighty gives them understanding.


## Job 32:9 (id: 1818032009)

9It is not the great who are wise, nor the aged who understand justice.


## Job 32:10 (id: 1818032010)

10Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.’


## Job 32:11 (id: 1818032011)

11“Behold, I waited for your words, and I listened for your reasoning, while you searched out what to say.


## Job 32:12 (id: 1818032012)

12Yes, I gave you my full attention, but there was no one who convinced Job, or who answered his words, among you.


## Job 32:13 (id: 1818032013)

13Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom. God may refute him, not man;’


## Job 32:14 (id: 1818032014)

14for he has not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches.


## Job 32:15 (id: 1818032015)

15“They are amazed. They answer no more. They don’t have a word to say.


## Job 32:16 (id: 1818032016)

16Shall I wait, because they don’t speak, because they stand still, and answer no more?


## Job 32:17 (id: 1818032017)

17I also will answer my part, and I also will show my opinion.


## Job 32:18 (id: 1818032018)

18For I am full of words. The spirit within me constrains me.


## Job 32:19 (id: 1818032019)

19Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent; like new wineskins it is ready to burst.


## Job 32:20 (id: 1818032020)

20I will speak, that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.


## Job 32:21 (id: 1818032021)

21Please don’t let me respect any man’s person, neither will I give flattering titles to any man.


## Job 32:22 (id: 1818032022)

22For I don’t know how to give flattering titles, or else my Maker would soon take me away.


## Job 33:1 (id: 1818033001)

1“However, Job, please hear my speech, and listen to all my words.


## Job 33:2 (id: 1818033002)

2See now, I have opened my mouth. My tongue has spoken in my mouth.


## Job 33:3 (id: 1818033003)

3My words will utter the uprightness of my heart. That which my lips know they will speak sincerely.


## Job 33:4 (id: 1818033004)

4The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.


## Job 33:5 (id: 1818033005)

5If you can, answer me. Set your words in order before me, and stand up.


## Job 33:6 (id: 1818033006)

6Behold, I am toward God even as you are. I am also formed out of the clay.


## Job 33:7 (id: 1818033007)

7Behold, my terror will not make you afraid, neither will my pressure be heavy on you.


## Job 33:8 (id: 1818033008)

8“Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice of your words, saying,


## Job 33:9 (id: 1818033009)

9‘I am clean, without disobedience. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.


## Job 33:10 (id: 1818033010)

10Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy.


## Job 33:11 (id: 1818033011)

11He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.’


## Job 33:12 (id: 1818033012)

12“Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just, for God is greater than man.


## Job 33:13 (id: 1818033013)

13Why do you strive against him, because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?


## Job 33:14 (id: 1818033014)

14For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention.


## Job 33:15 (id: 1818033015)

15In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumbering on the bed,


## Job 33:16 (id: 1818033016)

16then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,


## Job 33:17 (id: 1818033017)

17that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.


## Job 33:18 (id: 1818033018)

18He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.


## Job 33:19 (id: 1818033019)

19“He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones,


## Job 33:20 (id: 1818033020)

20so that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food.


## Job 33:21 (id: 1818033021)

21His flesh is so consumed away that it can’t be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out.


## Job 33:22 (id: 1818033022)

22Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.


## Job 33:23 (id: 1818033023)

23“If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him,


## Job 33:24 (id: 1818033024)

24then God is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’


## Job 33:25 (id: 1818033025)

25His flesh will be fresher than a child’s. He returns to the days of his youth.


## Job 33:26 (id: 1818033026)

26He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness.


## Job 33:27 (id: 1818033027)

27He sings before men, and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn’t profit me.


## Job 33:28 (id: 1818033028)

28He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life will see the light.’


## Job 33:29 (id: 1818033029)

29“Behold, God does all these things, twice, yes three times, with a man,


## Job 33:30 (id: 1818033030)

30to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.


## Job 33:31 (id: 1818033031)

31Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak.


## Job 33:32 (id: 1818033032)

32If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you.


## Job 33:33 (id: 1818033033)

33If not, listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”


## Job 34:1 (id: 1818034001)

1Moreover Elihu answered,


## Job 34:2 (id: 1818034002)

2“Hear my words, you wise men. Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.


## Job 34:3 (id: 1818034003)

3For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food.


## Job 34:4 (id: 1818034004)

4Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good.


## Job 34:5 (id: 1818034005)

5For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, God has taken away my right.


## Job 34:6 (id: 1818034006)

6Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’


## Job 34:7 (id: 1818034007)

7What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water,


## Job 34:8 (id: 1818034008)

8who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men?


## Job 34:9 (id: 1818034009)

9For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.’


## Job 34:10 (id: 1818034010)

10“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.


## Job 34:11 (id: 1818034011)

11For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.


## Job 34:12 (id: 1818034012)

12Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice.


## Job 34:13 (id: 1818034013)

13Who put him in charge of the earth? Or who has appointed him over the whole world?


## Job 34:14 (id: 1818034014)

14If he set his heart on himself, if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,


## Job 34:15 (id: 1818034015)

15all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.


## Job 34:16 (id: 1818034016)

16“If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words.


## Job 34:17 (id: 1818034017)

17Should even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,


## Job 34:18 (id: 1818034018)

18who says to a king, ‘Vile!’ or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?


## Job 34:19 (id: 1818034019)

19He doesn’t respect the persons of princes, nor respect the rich more than the poor, for they all are the work of his hands.


## Job 34:20 (id: 1818034020)

20In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand.


## Job 34:21 (id: 1818034021)

21“For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings.


## Job 34:22 (id: 1818034022)

22There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.


## Job 34:23 (id: 1818034023)

23For he doesn’t need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment.


## Job 34:24 (id: 1818034024)

24He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out, and sets others in their place.


## Job 34:25 (id: 1818034025)

25Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.


## Job 34:26 (id: 1818034026)

26He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;


## Job 34:27 (id: 1818034027)

27because they turned away from following him, and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,


## Job 34:28 (id: 1818034028)

28so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted.


## Job 34:29 (id: 1818034029)

29When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? He is over a nation or a man alike,


## Job 34:30 (id: 1818034030)

30that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people.


## Job 34:31 (id: 1818034031)

31“For has any said to God, ‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.


## Job 34:32 (id: 1818034032)

32Teach me that which I don’t see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?


## Job 34:33 (id: 1818034033)

33Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know.


## Job 34:34 (id: 1818034034)

34Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man who hears me:


## Job 34:35 (id: 1818034035)

35‘Job speaks without knowledge. His words are without wisdom.’


## Job 34:36 (id: 1818034036)

36I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering like wicked men.


## Job 34:37 (id: 1818034037)

37For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.”


## Job 35:1 (id: 1818035001)

1Moreover Elihu answered,


## Job 35:2 (id: 1818035002)

2“Do you think this to be your right, or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’


## Job 35:3 (id: 1818035003)

3that you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you? What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’


## Job 35:4 (id: 1818035004)

4I will answer you, and your companions with you.


## Job 35:5 (id: 1818035005)

5Look to the skies, and see. See the skies, which are higher than you.


## Job 35:6 (id: 1818035006)

6If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him? If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?


## Job 35:7 (id: 1818035007)

7If you are righteous, what do you give him? Or what does he receive from your hand?


## Job 35:8 (id: 1818035008)

8Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and your righteousness may profit a son of man.


## Job 35:9 (id: 1818035009)

9“By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out. They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.


## Job 35:10 (id: 1818035010)

10But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,


## Job 35:11 (id: 1818035011)

11who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’


## Job 35:12 (id: 1818035012)

12There they cry, but no one answers, because of the pride of evil men.


## Job 35:13 (id: 1818035013)

13Surely God will not hear an empty cry, neither will the Almighty regard it.


## Job 35:14 (id: 1818035014)

14How much less when you say you don’t see him. The cause is before him, and you wait for him!


## Job 35:15 (id: 1818035015)

15But now, because he has not visited in his anger, neither does he greatly regard arrogance,


## Job 35:16 (id: 1818035016)

16therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk, and he multiplies words without knowledge.”


## Job 36:1 (id: 1818036001)

1Elihu also continued, and said,


## Job 36:2 (id: 1818036002)

2“Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.


## Job 36:3 (id: 1818036003)

3I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.


## Job 36:4 (id: 1818036004)

4For truly my words are not false. One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.


## Job 36:5 (id: 1818036005)

5“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone. He is mighty in strength of understanding.


## Job 36:6 (id: 1818036006)

6He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the afflicted.


## Job 36:7 (id: 1818036007)

7He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne, he sets them forever, and they are exalted.


## Job 36:8 (id: 1818036008)

8If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the cords of afflictions,


## Job 36:9 (id: 1818036009)

9then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.


## Job 36:10 (id: 1818036010)

10He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity.


## Job 36:11 (id: 1818036011)

11If they listen and serve him, they will spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.


## Job 36:12 (id: 1818036012)

12But if they don’t listen, they will perish by the sword; they will die without knowledge.


## Job 36:13 (id: 1818036013)

13“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. They don’t cry for help when he binds them.


## Job 36:14 (id: 1818036014)

14They die in youth. Their life perishes among the unclean.


## Job 36:15 (id: 1818036015)

15He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear in oppression.


## Job 36:16 (id: 1818036016)

16Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a wide place, where there is no restriction. That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.


## Job 36:17 (id: 1818036017)

17“But you are full of the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you.


## Job 36:18 (id: 1818036018)

18Don’t let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.


## Job 36:19 (id: 1818036019)

19Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might of your strength?


## Job 36:20 (id: 1818036020)

20Don’t desire the night, when people are cut off in their place.


## Job 36:21 (id: 1818036021)

21Take heed, don’t regard iniquity; for you have chosen this rather than affliction.


## Job 36:22 (id: 1818036022)

22Behold, God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?


## Job 36:23 (id: 1818036023)

23Who has prescribed his way for him? Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness’?


## Job 36:24 (id: 1818036024)

24“Remember that you magnify his work, about which men have sung.


## Job 36:25 (id: 1818036025)

25All men have looked on it. Man sees it afar off.


## Job 36:26 (id: 1818036026)

26Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him. The number of his years is unsearchable.


## Job 36:27 (id: 1818036027)

27For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain from his vapor,


## Job 36:28 (id: 1818036028)

28which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly.


## Job 36:29 (id: 1818036029)

29Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds and the thunderings of his pavilion?


## Job 36:30 (id: 1818036030)

30Behold, he spreads his light around him. He covers the bottom of the sea.


## Job 36:31 (id: 1818036031)

31For by these he judges the people. He gives food in abundance.


## Job 36:32 (id: 1818036032)

32He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark.


## Job 36:33 (id: 1818036033)

33Its noise tells about him, and the livestock also, concerning the storm that comes up.


## Job 37:1 (id: 1818037001)

1“Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place.


## Job 37:2 (id: 1818037002)

2Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes out of his mouth.


## Job 37:3 (id: 1818037003)

3He sends it out under the whole sky, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.


## Job 37:4 (id: 1818037004)

4After it a voice roars. He thunders with the voice of his majesty. He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard.


## Job 37:5 (id: 1818037005)

5God thunders marvelously with his voice. He does great things, which we can’t comprehend.


## Job 37:6 (id: 1818037006)

6For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain.


## Job 37:7 (id: 1818037007)

7He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has made may know it.


## Job 37:8 (id: 1818037008)

8Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens.


## Job 37:9 (id: 1818037009)

9Out of its room comes the storm, and cold out of the north.


## Job 37:10 (id: 1818037010)

10By the breath of God, ice is given, and the width of the waters is frozen.


## Job 37:11 (id: 1818037011)

11Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.


## Job 37:12 (id: 1818037012)

12It is turned around by his guidance, that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world,


## Job 37:13 (id: 1818037013)

13whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come.


## Job 37:14 (id: 1818037014)

14“Listen to this, Job. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.


## Job 37:15 (id: 1818037015)

15Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?


## Job 37:16 (id: 1818037016)

16Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?


## Job 37:17 (id: 1818037017)

17You whose clothing is warm when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?


## Job 37:18 (id: 1818037018)

18Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a cast metal mirror?


## Job 37:19 (id: 1818037019)

19Teach us what we will tell him, for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness.


## Job 37:20 (id: 1818037020)

20Will it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?


## Job 37:21 (id: 1818037021)

21Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies, but the wind passes, and clears them.


## Job 37:22 (id: 1818037022)

22Out of the north comes golden splendor. With God is awesome majesty.


## Job 37:23 (id: 1818037023)

23We can’t reach the Almighty. He is exalted in power. In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress.


## Job 37:24 (id: 1818037024)

24Therefore men revere him. He doesn’t regard any who are wise of heart.”


## Job 38:1 (id: 1818038001)

1Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind,


## Job 38:2 (id: 1818038002)

2“Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?


## Job 38:3 (id: 1818038003)

3Brace yourself like a man, for I will question you, then you answer me!

4“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding.

5Who determined its measures, if you know? Or who stretched the line on it?


## Job 38:6 (id: 1818038006)

6What were its foundations fastened on? Or who laid its cornerstone,


## Job 38:7 (id: 1818038007)

7when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?


## Job 38:8 (id: 1818038008)

8“Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke out of the womb,


## Job 38:9 (id: 1818038009)

9when I made clouds its garment, and wrapped it in thick darkness,


## Job 38:10 (id: 1818038010)

10marked out for it my bound, set bars and doors,


## Job 38:11 (id: 1818038011)

11and said, ‘You may come here, but no further. Your proud waves shall be stopped here’?

12“Have you commanded the morning in your days, and caused the dawn to know its place,


## Job 38:13 (id: 1818038013)

13that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and shake the wicked out of it?


## Job 38:14 (id: 1818038014)

14It is changed as clay under the seal, and presented as a garment.


## Job 38:15 (id: 1818038015)

15From the wicked, their light is withheld. The high arm is broken.


## Job 38:16 (id: 1818038016)

16“Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?


## Job 38:17 (id: 1818038017)

17Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?


## Job 38:18 (id: 1818038018)

18Have you comprehended the earth in its width? Declare, if you know it all.


## Job 38:19 (id: 1818038019)

19“What is the way to the dwelling of light? As for darkness, where is its place,

20that you should take it to its bound, that you should discern the paths to its house?

21Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!

22Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,

23which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?

25Who has cut a channel for the flood water, or the path for the thunderstorm,

27to satisfy the waste and desolate ground, to cause the tender grass to grow?


## Job 38:28 (id: 1818038028)

28Does the rain have a father? Or who fathers the drops of dew?

29Whose womb did the ice come out of? Who has given birth to the gray frost of the sky?

13“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but are they the feathers and plumage of love?

15and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild animal may trample them.


## Job 39:16 (id: 1818039016)

16She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers. Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,


## Job 39:17 (id: 1818039017)

17because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding.

23The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin.

24He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.

26“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her wings toward the south?

28On the cliff he dwells and makes his home, on the point of the cliff and the stronghold.


## Job 39:29 (id: 1818039029)

29From there he spies out the prey. His eyes see it afar off.

30His young ones also suck up blood. Where the slain are, there he is.”

2“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.”


## Job 40:3 (id: 1818040003)

3Then Job answered the LORD,

4“Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.


## Job 40:5 (id: 1818040005)

5I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”


## Job 40:6 (id: 1818040006)

7“Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me.


## Job 40:8 (id: 1818040008)

8Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?

9Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him?

10“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty.

11Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.

12Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place.

13Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place.

14Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you.


## Job 40:15 (id: 1818040015)

15“See now behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox.

16Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly.


## Job 40:17 (id: 1818040017)

17He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together.


## Job 40:18 (id: 1818040018)

18His bones are like tubes of bronze. His limbs are like bars of iron.


## Job 40:19 (id: 1818040019)

19He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword.

20Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play.

21He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.

22The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him.


## Job 40:23 (id: 1818040023)

23Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.

24Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?

3Will he make many petitions to you, or will he speak soft words to you?

4Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever?

7Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?


## Job 41:8 (id: 1818041008)

8Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle, and do so no more.


## Job 41:9 (id: 1818041009)

9Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?


## Job 41:10 (id: 1818041010)

10None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me?

11Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Everything under the heavens is mine.


## Job 41:12 (id: 1818041012)

12“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.


## Job 41:13 (id: 1818041013)

13Who can strip off his outer garment? Who will come within his jaws?


## Job 41:14 (id: 1818041014)

14Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.

16One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

17They are joined to one another. They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart.


## Job 41:18 (id: 1818041018)

18His sneezing flashes out light. His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

19Out of his mouth go burning torches. Sparks of fire leap out.

20Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.

22There is strength in his neck. Terror dances before him.


## Job 41:23 (id: 1818041023)

23The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm on him. They can’t be moved.


## Job 41:24 (id: 1818041024)

24His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, firm as the lower millstone.


## Job 41:25 (id: 1818041025)

25When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. They retreat before his thrashing.


## Job 41:26 (id: 1818041026)

26If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.


## Job 41:27 (id: 1818041027)

27He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.


## Job 41:28 (id: 1818041028)

28The arrow can’t make him flee. Sling stones are like chaff to him.


## Job 41:29 (id: 1818041029)

29Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.

30His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.


## Job 41:31 (id: 1818041031)

31He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

32He makes a path shine after him. One would think the deep had white hair.

33On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear.

34He sees everything that is high. He is king over all the sons of pride.”


## Job 42:1 (id: 1818042001)

1Then Job answered the LORD:


## Job 42:2 (id: 1818042002)

2“I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.


## Job 42:3 (id: 1818042003)

3You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’ therefore I have uttered that which I didn’t understand, things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.


## Job 42:4 (id: 1818042004)

4You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you will answer me.’


## Job 42:5 (id: 1818042005)

5I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you.


## Job 42:6 (id: 1818042006)

6Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.”


## Job 42:7 (id: 1818042007)

7It was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.


## Job 42:8 (id: 1818042008)

8Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”


## Job 42:9 (id: 1818042009)

9So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD commanded them, and the LORD accepted Job.


## Job 42:10 (id: 1818042010)

10The LORD restored Job’s prosperity when he prayed for his friends. The LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.


## Job 42:11 (id: 1818042011)

11Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that the LORD had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money, and everyone a ring of gold.


## Job 42:12 (id: 1818042012)

12So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.


## Job 42:13 (id: 1818042013)

13He had also seven sons and three daughters.


## Job 42:14 (id: 1818042014)

14He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.


## Job 42:15 (id: 1818042015)

15In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.


## Job 42:16 (id: 1818042016)

16After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations.


## Job 42:17 (id: 1818042017)

17So Job died, being old and full of days.
