## 1 Chronicles 19:3 (id: 1813019003)

## 1 Chronicles 21:4 (id: 1813021004)

## 1 Chronicles 21:11 (id: 1813021011)

11So Gad came to David and said to him, “The LORD says, ‘Take your choice:


## 1 Chronicles 21:12 (id: 1813021012)

12either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of the LORD, even pestilence in the land, and the LORD’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’”


## 1 Chronicles 21:13 (id: 1813021013)

13David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the LORD’s hand, for his mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:14 (id: 1813021014)

14So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.


## 1 Chronicles 21:15 (id: 1813021015)

15God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, the LORD saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” the LORD’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.


## 1 Chronicles 21:16 (id: 1813021016)

16David lifted up his eyes, and saw the LORD’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.


## 1 Chronicles 21:17 (id: 1813021017)

17David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:18 (id: 1813021018)

18Then the LORD’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.


## 1 Chronicles 21:19 (id: 1813021019)

19David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the LORD’s name.


## 1 Chronicles 21:20 (id: 1813021020)

20Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.


## 1 Chronicles 21:21 (id: 1813021021)

21As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.


## 1 Chronicles 21:22 (id: 1813021022)

22Then David said to Ornan, “Sell me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the LORD on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:23 (id: 1813021023)

23Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:24 (id: 1813021024)

24King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for the LORD, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:25 (id: 1813021025)

25So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.


## 1 Chronicles 21:26 (id: 1813021026)

26David built an altar to the LORD there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.


## 1 Chronicles 21:27 (id: 1813021027)

27Then the LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.


## 1 Chronicles 21:28 (id: 1813021028)

28At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.


## 1 Chronicles 21:29 (id: 1813021029)

29For the LORD’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.


## 1 Chronicles 21:30 (id: 1813021030)

30But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of the LORD’s angel.


## 1 Chronicles 22:1 (id: 1813022001)

1Then David said, “This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:2 (id: 1813022002)

2David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build God’s house.


## 1 Chronicles 22:3 (id: 1813022003)

3David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings, and bronze in abundance without weight,


## 1 Chronicles 22:4 (id: 1813022004)

4and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.


## 1 Chronicles 22:5 (id: 1813022005)

5David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death.


## 1 Chronicles 22:6 (id: 1813022006)

6Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 22:7 (id: 1813022007)

7David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:8 (id: 1813022008)

8But the LORD’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.


## 1 Chronicles 22:9 (id: 1813022009)

9Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.


## 1 Chronicles 22:10 (id: 1813022010)

10He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’


## 1 Chronicles 22:11 (id: 1813022011)

11Now, my son, may the LORD be with you and prosper you, and build the house of the LORD your God, as he has spoken concerning you.


## 1 Chronicles 22:12 (id: 1813022012)

12May the LORD give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:13 (id: 1813022013)

13Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid and don’t be dismayed.


## 1 Chronicles 22:14 (id: 1813022014)

14Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the LORD’s house one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.


## 1 Chronicles 22:15 (id: 1813022015)

15There are also workmen with you in abundance—cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work;


## 1 Chronicles 22:16 (id: 1813022016)

16of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may the LORD be with you.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:17 (id: 1813022017)

17David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,


## 1 Chronicles 22:18 (id: 1813022018)

18“Isn’t the LORD your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD and before his people.


## 1 Chronicles 22:19 (id: 1813022019)

19Now set your heart and your soul to follow the LORD your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the LORD’s covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the LORD’s name.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:1 (id: 1813023001)

1Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 23:2 (id: 1813023002)

2He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.


## 1 Chronicles 23:3 (id: 1813023003)

3The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty\-eight thousand.


## 1 Chronicles 23:4 (id: 1813023004)

4David said, “Of these, twenty\-four thousand were to oversee the work of the LORD’s house, six thousand were officers and judges,


## 1 Chronicles 23:5 (id: 1813023005)

5four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made for giving praise.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:6 (id: 1813023006)

6David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.


## 1 Chronicles 23:7 (id: 1813023007)

7Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.


## 1 Chronicles 23:8 (id: 1813023008)

8The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three.


## 1 Chronicles 23:9 (id: 1813023009)

9The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan.


## 1 Chronicles 23:10 (id: 1813023010)

10The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.


## 1 Chronicles 23:11 (id: 1813023011)

11Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.


## 1 Chronicles 23:12 (id: 1813023012)

12The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.


## 1 Chronicles 23:13 (id: 1813023013)

13The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name forever.


## 1 Chronicles 23:14 (id: 1813023014)

14But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.


## 1 Chronicles 23:15 (id: 1813023015)

15The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.


## 1 Chronicles 23:16 (id: 1813023016)

16The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.


## 1 Chronicles 23:17 (id: 1813023017)

17The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.


## 1 Chronicles 23:18 (id: 1813023018)

18The son of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.

20The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.


## 1 Chronicles 23:21 (id: 1813023021)

21The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.


## 1 Chronicles 23:22 (id: 1813023022)

22Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only; and their relatives, the sons of Kish, took them as wives.


## 1 Chronicles 23:23 (id: 1813023023)

23The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.


## 1 Chronicles 23:24 (id: 1813023024)

24These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the LORD’s house, from twenty years old and upward.


## 1 Chronicles 23:25 (id: 1813023025)

25For David said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.


## 1 Chronicles 23:26 (id: 1813023026)

26Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:27 (id: 1813023027)

27For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward.


## 1 Chronicles 23:28 (id: 1813023028)

28For their duty was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the LORD’s house—in the courts, in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God’s house;


## 1 Chronicles 23:29 (id: 1813023029)

29for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size;


## 1 Chronicles 23:30 (id: 1813023030)

30and to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise in the evening;


## 1 Chronicles 23:31 (id: 1813023031)

31and to offer all burnt offerings to the LORD on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before the LORD;


## 1 Chronicles 23:32 (id: 1813023032)

32and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers for the service of the LORD’s house.


## 1 Chronicles 24:1 (id: 1813024001)

1These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.


## 1 Chronicles 24:2 (id: 1813024002)

2But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.


## 1 Chronicles 24:3 (id: 1813024003)

3David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.


## 1 Chronicles 24:4 (id: 1813024004)

4There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.


## 1 Chronicles 24:5 (id: 1813024005)

5Thus they were divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.


## 1 Chronicles 24:6 (id: 1813024006)

6Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.
