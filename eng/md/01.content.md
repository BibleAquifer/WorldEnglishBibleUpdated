2The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,

5but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.

6The LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?


## Genesis 4:7 (id: 1801004007)

7If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”

## Genesis 7:10 (id: 1801007010)

10After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth.


## Genesis 7:11 (id: 1801007011)

## Genesis 7:14 (id: 1801007014)

14they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.

16Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; then the LORD shut him in.


## Genesis 7:17 (id: 1801007017)

17The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.


## Genesis 7:18 (id: 1801007018)

18The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.

19The waters rose very high on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.

20The waters rose fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered.

24The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.


## Genesis 8:1 (id: 1801008001)

1God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided.


## Genesis 8:2 (id: 1801008002)

2The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.


## Genesis 8:3 (id: 1801008003)

3The waters continually receded from the earth. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters receded.


## Genesis 8:4 (id: 1801008004)

4The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains.


## Genesis 8:5 (id: 1801008005)

5The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible.


## Genesis 8:6 (id: 1801008006)

6At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,


## Genesis 8:7 (id: 1801008007)

7and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.


## Genesis 8:8 (id: 1801008008)

8He himself sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,


## Genesis 8:9 (id: 1801008009)

9but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship.


## Genesis 8:10 (id: 1801008010)

10He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship.


## Genesis 8:11 (id: 1801008011)

11The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth.


## Genesis 8:12 (id: 1801008012)

12He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him any more.


## Genesis 8:13 (id: 1801008013)

13In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dry.


## Genesis 8:14 (id: 1801008014)

14In the second month, on the twenty\-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.

15God spoke to Noah, saying,

16“Go out of the ship, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.


## Genesis 8:17 (id: 1801008017)

17Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.”


## Genesis 8:18 (id: 1801008018)

18Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.


## Genesis 8:19 (id: 1801008019)

19Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.


## Genesis 8:20 (id: 1801008020)

20Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.


## Genesis 8:21 (id: 1801008021)

21The LORD smelled the pleasant aroma. The LORD said in his heart, “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake because the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth. I will never again strike every living thing, as I have done.


## Genesis 8:22 (id: 1801008022)

1God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth.


## Genesis 9:2 (id: 1801009002)

2The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that moves along the ground, and all the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand.


## Genesis 9:3 (id: 1801009003)

3Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you.


## Genesis 9:4 (id: 1801009004)

4But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat.


## Genesis 9:5 (id: 1801009005)

5I will surely require accounting for your life’s blood. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man.


## Genesis 9:6 (id: 1801009006)

6Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image.


## Genesis 9:7 (id: 1801009007)

7Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.”


## Genesis 9:8 (id: 1801009008)

8God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,


## Genesis 9:9 (id: 1801009009)

9“As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,


## Genesis 9:10 (id: 1801009010)

10and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.


## Genesis 9:11 (id: 1801009011)

11I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”


## Genesis 9:12 (id: 1801009012)

12God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:


## Genesis 9:13 (id: 1801009013)

13I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.


## Genesis 9:14 (id: 1801009014)

14When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,


## Genesis 9:15 (id: 1801009015)

15I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.


## Genesis 9:16 (id: 1801009016)

16The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”

20Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.


## Genesis 9:21 (id: 1801009021)

21He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.


## Genesis 9:22 (id: 1801009022)

22Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.


## Genesis 9:23 (id: 1801009023)

23Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness.


## Genesis 9:24 (id: 1801009024)

24Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.

25He said, “Canaan is cursed. He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.”

7Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”

28Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, while his father Terah was still alive.


## Genesis 11:29 (id: 1801011029)

29Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah.


## Genesis 11:30 (id: 1801011030)

30Sarai was barren. She had no child.


## Genesis 11:31 (id: 1801011031)

31Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter\-in\-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.


## Genesis 11:32 (id: 1801011032)

32The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.


## Genesis 12:1 (id: 1801012001)

1Now the LORD said to Abram, “Leave your country, and your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you.


## Genesis 12:2 (id: 1801012002)

2I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.


## Genesis 12:3 (id: 1801012003)

3I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who treats you with contempt. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”


## Genesis 12:4 (id: 1801012004)

4So Abram went, as the LORD had told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy\-five years old when he departed from Haran.


## Genesis 12:5 (id: 1801012005)

5Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan.


## Genesis 12:6 (id: 1801012006)

6Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time, Canaanites were in the land.


## Genesis 12:7 (id: 1801012007)

7The LORD appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.” He built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him.


## Genesis 12:8 (id: 1801012008)

8He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD and called on the LORD’s name.


## Genesis 12:9 (id: 1801012009)

9Abram traveled, still going on toward the South.


## Genesis 12:10 (id: 1801012010)

10There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.


## Genesis 12:11 (id: 1801012011)

11When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.


## Genesis 12:12 (id: 1801012012)

12It will happen that when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive.


## Genesis 12:13 (id: 1801012013)

13Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.”


## Genesis 12:14 (id: 1801012014)

14When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.


## Genesis 12:15 (id: 1801012015)

15The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.


## Genesis 12:16 (id: 1801012016)

16He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.


## Genesis 12:17 (id: 1801012017)

17The LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.


## Genesis 12:18 (id: 1801012018)

18Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?


## Genesis 12:19 (id: 1801012019)

19Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”


## Genesis 12:20 (id: 1801012020)

20Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had.


## Genesis 13:1 (id: 1801013001)

1Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South.


## Genesis 13:2 (id: 1801013002)

2Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.


## Genesis 13:3 (id: 1801013003)

3He went on his journeys from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,


## Genesis 13:4 (id: 1801013004)

4to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on the LORD’s name.


## Genesis 13:5 (id: 1801013005)

5Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.


## Genesis 13:6 (id: 1801013006)

6The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together.


## Genesis 13:7 (id: 1801013007)

7There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.


## Genesis 13:8 (id: 1801013008)

8Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.


## Genesis 13:9 (id: 1801013009)

9Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”


## Genesis 13:10 (id: 1801013010)

10Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well\-watered everywhere, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.


## Genesis 13:11 (id: 1801013011)

11So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves from one other.


## Genesis 13:12 (id: 1801013012)

12Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.


## Genesis 13:13 (id: 1801013013)

13Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against the LORD.


## Genesis 13:14 (id: 1801013014)

14The LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,


## Genesis 13:15 (id: 1801013015)

15for I will give all the land which you see to you and to your offspring forever.


## Genesis 13:16 (id: 1801013016)

16I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted.


## Genesis 13:17 (id: 1801013017)

17Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.”


## Genesis 13:18 (id: 1801013018)

18Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to the LORD.


## Genesis 14:1 (id: 1801014001)

1In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar; Arioch, king of Ellasar; Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goiim,


## Genesis 14:2 (id: 1801014002)

2they made war with Bera, king of Sodom; Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, king of Admah; Shemeber, king of Zeboiim; and the king of Bela (also called Zoar).


## Genesis 14:3 (id: 1801014003)

3All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea).


## Genesis 14:4 (id: 1801014004)

4They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.


## Genesis 14:5 (id: 1801014005)

5In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,


## Genesis 14:6 (id: 1801014006)

6and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to El Paran, which is by the wilderness.


## Genesis 14:7 (id: 1801014007)

7They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also called Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar.


## Genesis 14:8 (id: 1801014008)

8The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim


## Genesis 14:9 (id: 1801014009)

9against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.


## Genesis 14:10 (id: 1801014010)

10Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and some fell there. Those who remained fled to the hills.


## Genesis 14:11 (id: 1801014011)

11They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.


## Genesis 14:12 (id: 1801014012)

12They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.


## Genesis 14:13 (id: 1801014013)

13One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. At that time, he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner. They were allies of Abram.


## Genesis 14:14 (id: 1801014014)

14When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his three hundred eighteen trained men, born in his house, and pursued as far as Dan.


## Genesis 14:15 (id: 1801014015)

15He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.


## Genesis 14:16 (id: 1801014016)

16He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot and his goods, and the women also, and the other people.


## Genesis 14:17 (id: 1801014017)

17The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).


## Genesis 14:18 (id: 1801014018)

18Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High.


## Genesis 14:19 (id: 1801014019)

19He blessed him, and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth.


## Genesis 14:20 (id: 1801014020)

20Blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” Abram gave him a tenth of all.


## Genesis 14:21 (id: 1801014021)

21The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.”


## Genesis 14:22 (id: 1801014022)

22Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to the LORD, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,


## Genesis 14:23 (id: 1801014023)

23that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’


## Genesis 14:24 (id: 1801014024)

24I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.”


## Genesis 15:1 (id: 1801015001)

1After these things the LORD’s word came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”


## Genesis 15:2 (id: 1801015002)

2Abram said, “Lord GOD, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”


## Genesis 15:3 (id: 1801015003)

3Abram said, “Behold, you have given no children to me: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.”


## Genesis 15:4 (id: 1801015004)

4Behold, the LORD’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.”


## Genesis 15:5 (id: 1801015005)

5The LORD brought him outside, and said, “Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He said to Abram, “So your offspring will be.”


## Genesis 15:6 (id: 1801015006)

6He believed in the LORD, who credited it to him for righteousness.


## Genesis 15:7 (id: 1801015007)

7He said to Abram, “I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.”


## Genesis 15:8 (id: 1801015008)

8He said, “Lord GOD, how will I know that I will inherit it?”


## Genesis 15:9 (id: 1801015009)

9He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”


## Genesis 15:10 (id: 1801015010)

10He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds.


## Genesis 15:11 (id: 1801015011)

11The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.


## Genesis 15:12 (id: 1801015012)

12When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.


## Genesis 15:13 (id: 1801015013)

13He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.


## Genesis 15:14 (id: 1801015014)

14I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth;


## Genesis 15:15 (id: 1801015015)

15but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age.


## Genesis 15:16 (id: 1801015016)

16In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.”


## Genesis 15:17 (id: 1801015017)

17It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.


## Genesis 15:18 (id: 1801015018)

18In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I have given this land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:


## Genesis 15:19 (id: 1801015019)

19the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,


## Genesis 15:20 (id: 1801015020)

20the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,


## Genesis 15:21 (id: 1801015021)

21the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”


## Genesis 16:1 (id: 1801016001)

1Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children. She had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.


## Genesis 16:2 (id: 1801016002)

2Sarai said to Abram, “See now, the LORD has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my servant. It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.


## Genesis 16:3 (id: 1801016003)

3Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.


## Genesis 16:4 (id: 1801016004)

4He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.


## Genesis 16:5 (id: 1801016005)

5Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault. I gave my servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, she despised me. May the LORD judge between me and you.”


## Genesis 16:6 (id: 1801016006)

6But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes.” Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.


## Genesis 16:7 (id: 1801016007)

7The LORD’s angel found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.


## Genesis 16:8 (id: 1801016008)

8He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s servant, where did you come from? Where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.”


## Genesis 16:9 (id: 1801016009)

9The LORD’s angel said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.”


## Genesis 16:10 (id: 1801016010)

10The LORD’s angel said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring, that they will not be counted for multitude.”


## Genesis 16:11 (id: 1801016011)

11The LORD’s angel said to her, “Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has heard your affliction.


## Genesis 16:12 (id: 1801016012)

12He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him. He will live opposed to all of his brothers.”


## Genesis 16:13 (id: 1801016013)

13She called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees,” for she said, “Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?”


## Genesis 16:14 (id: 1801016014)

14Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.


## Genesis 16:15 (id: 1801016015)

15Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.


## Genesis 16:16 (id: 1801016016)

16Abram was eighty\-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.


## Genesis 17:1 (id: 1801017001)

1When Abram was ninety\-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless.


## Genesis 17:2 (id: 1801017002)

2I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”


## Genesis 17:3 (id: 1801017003)

3Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying,


## Genesis 17:4 (id: 1801017004)

4“As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations.


## Genesis 17:5 (id: 1801017005)

5Your name will no more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.


## Genesis 17:6 (id: 1801017006)

6I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you.


## Genesis 17:7 (id: 1801017007)

7I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your offspring after you.


## Genesis 17:8 (id: 1801017008)

8I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God.”


## Genesis 17:9 (id: 1801017009)

9God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.


## Genesis 17:10 (id: 1801017010)

10This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised.


## Genesis 17:11 (id: 1801017011)

11You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.


## Genesis 17:12 (id: 1801017012)

12He who is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.


## Genesis 17:13 (id: 1801017013)

13He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.


## Genesis 17:14 (id: 1801017014)

14The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant.”


## Genesis 17:15 (id: 1801017015)

15God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name shall be Sarah.


## Genesis 17:16 (id: 1801017016)

16I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her.”


## Genesis 17:17 (id: 1801017017)

17Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?”


## Genesis 17:18 (id: 1801017018)

18Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!”


## Genesis 17:19 (id: 1801017019)

19God said, “No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.


## Genesis 17:20 (id: 1801017020)

20As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.


## Genesis 17:21 (id: 1801017021)

21But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.”


## Genesis 17:22 (id: 1801017022)

22When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.


## Genesis 17:23 (id: 1801017023)

23Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money: every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him.


## Genesis 17:24 (id: 1801017024)

## Genesis 17:27 (id: 1801017027)

27All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.


## Genesis 18:1 (id: 1801018001)

1The LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.


## Genesis 18:2 (id: 1801018002)

2He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood near him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,


## Genesis 18:3 (id: 1801018003)

3and said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don’t go away from your servant.


## Genesis 18:4 (id: 1801018004)

4Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.


## Genesis 18:5 (id: 1801018005)

6Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three seahs of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.”


## Genesis 18:7 (id: 1801018007)

7Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.


## Genesis 18:8 (id: 1801018008)

8He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.


## Genesis 18:9 (id: 1801018009)

9They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?” He said, “There, in the tent.”


## Genesis 18:10 (id: 1801018010)

10He said, “I will certainly return to you at about this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.” Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.


## Genesis 18:11 (id: 1801018011)

11Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.


## Genesis 18:12 (id: 1801018012)

12Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”


## Genesis 18:13 (id: 1801018013)

13The LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child when I am old?’


## Genesis 18:14 (id: 1801018014)

14Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes around, and Sarah will have a son.”


## Genesis 18:15 (id: 1801018015)

15Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh.”


## Genesis 18:16 (id: 1801018016)

16The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.


## Genesis 18:17 (id: 1801018017)

17The LORD said, “Will I hide from Abraham what I do,


## Genesis 18:18 (id: 1801018018)

18since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?


## Genesis 18:19 (id: 1801018019)

19For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.”


## Genesis 18:20 (id: 1801018020)

20The LORD said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,


## Genesis 18:21 (id: 1801018021)

21I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.”


## Genesis 18:22 (id: 1801018022)

22The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.


## Genesis 18:23 (id: 1801018023)

23Abraham came near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?


## Genesis 18:24 (id: 1801018024)

24What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?


## Genesis 18:25 (id: 1801018025)

25May it be far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?”


## Genesis 18:26 (id: 1801018026)

26The LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.”


## Genesis 18:27 (id: 1801018027)

27Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, although I am dust and ashes.


## Genesis 18:28 (id: 1801018028)

28What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?” He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty\-five there.”


## Genesis 18:29 (id: 1801018029)

29He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?” He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”


## Genesis 18:30 (id: 1801018030)

30He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?” He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”


## Genesis 18:31 (id: 1801018031)

31He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?” He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”


## Genesis 18:32 (id: 1801018032)

32He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?” He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”


## Genesis 18:33 (id: 1801018033)

33The LORD went his way as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.


## Genesis 19:1 (id: 1801019001)

1The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,


## Genesis 19:2 (id: 1801019002)

2and he said, “See now, my lords, please come into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.” They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”


## Genesis 19:3 (id: 1801019003)

3He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.


## Genesis 19:4 (id: 1801019004)

4But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.


## Genesis 19:5 (id: 1801019005)

5They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”


## Genesis 19:6 (id: 1801019006)

6Lot went out to them through the door, and shut the door after himself.


## Genesis 19:7 (id: 1801019007)

7He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.


## Genesis 19:8 (id: 1801019008)

8See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”


## Genesis 19:9 (id: 1801019009)

9They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door.


## Genesis 19:10 (id: 1801019010)

10But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.


## Genesis 19:11 (id: 1801019011)

11They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.


## Genesis 19:12 (id: 1801019012)

12The men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons\-in\-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:


## Genesis 19:13 (id: 1801019013)

13for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it.”


## Genesis 19:14 (id: 1801019014)

14Lot went out, and spoke to his sons\-in\-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy the city!” But he seemed to his sons\-in\-law to be joking.


## Genesis 19:15 (id: 1801019015)

15When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.”


## Genesis 19:16 (id: 1801019016)

16But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, the LORD being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.


## Genesis 19:17 (id: 1801019017)

17It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”


## Genesis 19:18 (id: 1801019018)

18Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.


## Genesis 19:19 (id: 1801019019)

19See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.


## Genesis 19:20 (id: 1801019020)

20See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.”


## Genesis 19:21 (id: 1801019021)

21He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.


## Genesis 19:22 (id: 1801019022)

22Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.


## Genesis 19:23 (id: 1801019023)

23The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.


## Genesis 19:24 (id: 1801019024)

24Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of the sky.


## Genesis 19:25 (id: 1801019025)

25He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.


## Genesis 19:26 (id: 1801019026)

26But Lot’s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.


## Genesis 19:27 (id: 1801019027)

27Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.


## Genesis 19:28 (id: 1801019028)

28He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.


## Genesis 19:29 (id: 1801019029)

29When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.


## Genesis 19:30 (id: 1801019030)

30Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.


## Genesis 19:31 (id: 1801019031)

31The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.


## Genesis 19:32 (id: 1801019032)

32Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”


## Genesis 19:33 (id: 1801019033)

33They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.


## Genesis 19:34 (id: 1801019034)

34It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”


## Genesis 19:35 (id: 1801019035)

35They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.


## Genesis 19:36 (id: 1801019036)

36Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father.


## Genesis 19:37 (id: 1801019037)

37The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.


## Genesis 19:38 (id: 1801019038)

38The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.


## Genesis 20:1 (id: 1801020001)

1Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.


## Genesis 20:2 (id: 1801020002)

2Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.


## Genesis 20:3 (id: 1801020003)

3But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man’s wife.”


## Genesis 20:4 (id: 1801020004)

4Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?


## Genesis 20:5 (id: 1801020005)

5Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”


## Genesis 20:6 (id: 1801020006)

6God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.


## Genesis 20:7 (id: 1801020007)

7Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”


## Genesis 20:8 (id: 1801020008)

8Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.


## Genesis 20:9 (id: 1801020009)

9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”


## Genesis 20:10 (id: 1801020010)

10Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”


## Genesis 20:11 (id: 1801020011)

11Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’


## Genesis 20:12 (id: 1801020012)

12Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.


## Genesis 20:13 (id: 1801020013)

13When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”


## Genesis 20:14 (id: 1801020014)

14Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.


## Genesis 20:15 (id: 1801020015)

15Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.”


## Genesis 20:16 (id: 1801020016)

16To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”


## Genesis 20:17 (id: 1801020017)

17Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.


## Genesis 20:18 (id: 1801020018)

18For the LORD had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.


## Genesis 21:1 (id: 1801021001)

1The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.


## Genesis 21:2 (id: 1801021002)

2Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.


## Genesis 21:3 (id: 1801021003)

3Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.


## Genesis 21:4 (id: 1801021004)

4Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.


## Genesis 21:5 (id: 1801021005)

5Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.


## Genesis 21:6 (id: 1801021006)

6Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.”


## Genesis 21:7 (id: 1801021007)

7She said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”


## Genesis 21:8 (id: 1801021008)

8The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.


## Genesis 21:9 (id: 1801021009)

9Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.


## Genesis 21:10 (id: 1801021010)

10Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac.”


## Genesis 21:11 (id: 1801021011)

11The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.


## Genesis 21:12 (id: 1801021012)

12God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring will be named through Isaac.


## Genesis 21:13 (id: 1801021013)

13I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child.”


## Genesis 21:14 (id: 1801021014)

14Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a container of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.


## Genesis 21:15 (id: 1801021015)

15The water in the container was spent, and she put the child under one of the shrubs.


## Genesis 21:16 (id: 1801021016)

16She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.


## Genesis 21:17 (id: 1801021017)

17God heard the voice of the boy. The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.


## Genesis 21:18 (id: 1801021018)

18Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand. For I will make him a great nation.”


## Genesis 21:19 (id: 1801021019)

19God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the container with water, and gave the boy a drink.


## Genesis 21:20 (id: 1801021020)

20God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and as he grew up, he became an archer.


## Genesis 21:21 (id: 1801021021)

21He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother got a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.


## Genesis 21:22 (id: 1801021022)

22At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do.


## Genesis 21:23 (id: 1801021023)

23Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.”


## Genesis 21:24 (id: 1801021024)

24Abraham said, “I will swear.”


## Genesis 21:25 (id: 1801021025)

25Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.


## Genesis 21:26 (id: 1801021026)

26Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.”


## Genesis 21:27 (id: 1801021027)

27Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.


## Genesis 21:28 (id: 1801021028)

28Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.


## Genesis 21:29 (id: 1801021029)

29Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs, which you have set by themselves, mean?”


## Genesis 21:30 (id: 1801021030)

30He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.”


## Genesis 21:31 (id: 1801021031)

31Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore an oath there.


## Genesis 21:32 (id: 1801021032)

32So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.


## Genesis 21:33 (id: 1801021033)

33Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.


## Genesis 21:34 (id: 1801021034)

34Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.


## Genesis 22:1 (id: 1801022001)

1After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.”


## Genesis 22:2 (id: 1801022002)

2He said, “Now take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.”


## Genesis 22:3 (id: 1801022003)

3Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey; and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.


## Genesis 22:4 (id: 1801022004)

4On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.


## Genesis 22:5 (id: 1801022005)

5Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there. We will worship, and come back to you.”


## Genesis 22:6 (id: 1801022006)

6Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.


## Genesis 22:7 (id: 1801022007)

7Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”


## Genesis 22:8 (id: 1801022008)

8Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together.


## Genesis 22:9 (id: 1801022009)

9They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.


## Genesis 22:10 (id: 1801022010)

10Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.


## Genesis 22:11 (id: 1801022011)

11The LORD’s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.”


## Genesis 22:12 (id: 1801022012)

12He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”


## Genesis 22:13 (id: 1801022013)

13Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.


## Genesis 22:14 (id: 1801022014)

14Abraham called the name of that place “The LORD Will Provide”. As it is said to this day, “On the LORD’s mountain, it will be provided.”


## Genesis 22:15 (id: 1801022015)

15The LORD’s angel called to Abraham a second time out of the sky,


## Genesis 22:16 (id: 1801022016)

16and said, “‘I have sworn by myself,’ says the LORD, ‘because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,


## Genesis 22:17 (id: 1801022017)

17that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies.


## Genesis 22:18 (id: 1801022018)

18All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring, because you have obeyed my voice.’”


## Genesis 22:19 (id: 1801022019)

19So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.


## Genesis 22:20 (id: 1801022020)

20After these things, Abraham was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:


## Genesis 22:21 (id: 1801022021)

21Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,


## Genesis 22:22 (id: 1801022022)

22Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”


## Genesis 22:23 (id: 1801022023)

23Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.


## Genesis 22:24 (id: 1801022024)

24His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.


## Genesis 23:1 (id: 1801023001)

1Sarah lived one hundred twenty\-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s life.


## Genesis 23:2 (id: 1801023002)

2Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.


## Genesis 23:3 (id: 1801023003)

3Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,


## Genesis 23:4 (id: 1801023004)

4“I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying\-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”


## Genesis 23:5 (id: 1801023005)

5The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,


## Genesis 23:6 (id: 1801023006)

6“Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”


## Genesis 23:7 (id: 1801023007)

7Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.


## Genesis 23:8 (id: 1801023008)

8He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,


## Genesis 23:9 (id: 1801023009)

9that he may sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him sell it to me among you as a possession for a burial place.”


## Genesis 23:10 (id: 1801023010)

10Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,


## Genesis 23:11 (id: 1801023011)

11“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”


## Genesis 23:12 (id: 1801023012)

12Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.


## Genesis 23:13 (id: 1801023013)

13He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”


## Genesis 23:14 (id: 1801023014)

14Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,


## Genesis 23:15 (id: 1801023015)

15“My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.”


## Genesis 23:16 (id: 1801023016)

16Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard.


## Genesis 23:17 (id: 1801023017)

17So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded


## Genesis 23:18 (id: 1801023018)

18to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.


## Genesis 23:19 (id: 1801023019)

19After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.


## Genesis 23:20 (id: 1801023020)

20The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the children of Heth as a possession for a burial place.


## Genesis 24:1 (id: 1801024001)

1Abraham was old, and well advanced in age. The LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.


## Genesis 24:2 (id: 1801024002)

2Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh.


## Genesis 24:3 (id: 1801024003)

3I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.


## Genesis 24:4 (id: 1801024004)

4But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”


## Genesis 24:5 (id: 1801024005)

5The servant said to him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?”


## Genesis 24:6 (id: 1801024006)

6Abraham said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again.


## Genesis 24:7 (id: 1801024007)

7The LORD, the God of heaven—who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your offspring—he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.


## Genesis 24:8 (id: 1801024008)

8If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.”


## Genesis 24:9 (id: 1801024009)

9The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.


## Genesis 24:10 (id: 1801024010)

10The servant took ten of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.


## Genesis 24:11 (id: 1801024011)

11He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.


## Genesis 24:12 (id: 1801024012)

12He said, “LORD, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.


## Genesis 24:13 (id: 1801024013)

13Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.


## Genesis 24:14 (id: 1801024014)

14Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ then she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”


## Genesis 24:15 (id: 1801024015)

15Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.


## Genesis 24:16 (id: 1801024016)

16The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.


## Genesis 24:17 (id: 1801024017)

17The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.”


## Genesis 24:18 (id: 1801024018)

18She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a drink.


## Genesis 24:19 (id: 1801024019)

19When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking.”


## Genesis 24:20 (id: 1801024020)

20She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.


## Genesis 24:21 (id: 1801024021)

21The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.


## Genesis 24:22 (id: 1801024022)

22As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,


## Genesis 24:23 (id: 1801024023)

23and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay?”


## Genesis 24:24 (id: 1801024024)

24She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”


## Genesis 24:25 (id: 1801024025)

25She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.”


## Genesis 24:26 (id: 1801024026)

26The man bowed his head, and worshiped the LORD.


## Genesis 24:27 (id: 1801024027)

27He said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.”


## Genesis 24:28 (id: 1801024028)

28The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words.


## Genesis 24:29 (id: 1801024029)

29Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.


## Genesis 24:30 (id: 1801024030)

30When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.


## Genesis 24:31 (id: 1801024031)

31He said, “Come in, you blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.”


## Genesis 24:32 (id: 1801024032)

32The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.


## Genesis 24:33 (id: 1801024033)

33Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.” Laban said, “Speak on.”


## Genesis 24:34 (id: 1801024034)

34He said, “I am Abraham’s servant.


## Genesis 24:35 (id: 1801024035)

35The LORD has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. The LORD has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.


## Genesis 24:36 (id: 1801024036)

36Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him.


## Genesis 24:37 (id: 1801024037)

37My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,


## Genesis 24:38 (id: 1801024038)

38but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’


## Genesis 24:39 (id: 1801024039)

39I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’


## Genesis 24:40 (id: 1801024040)

40He said to me, ‘The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house.


## Genesis 24:41 (id: 1801024041)

41Then you will be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’


## Genesis 24:42 (id: 1801024042)

42I came today to the spring, and said, ‘The LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go—


## Genesis 24:43 (id: 1801024043)

43behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,”


## Genesis 24:44 (id: 1801024044)

44then she tells me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’


## Genesis 24:45 (id: 1801024045)

45Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’


## Genesis 24:46 (id: 1801024046)

46She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.


## Genesis 24:47 (id: 1801024047)

47I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.


## Genesis 24:48 (id: 1801024048)

48I bowed my head, and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.


## Genesis 24:49 (id: 1801024049)

49Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.”


## Genesis 24:50 (id: 1801024050)

50Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from the LORD. We can’t speak to you bad or good.


## Genesis 24:51 (id: 1801024051)

51Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as the LORD has spoken.”


## Genesis 24:52 (id: 1801024052)

52When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to the LORD.


## Genesis 24:53 (id: 1801024053)

53The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother.


## Genesis 24:54 (id: 1801024054)

54They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”


## Genesis 24:55 (id: 1801024055)

55Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.”


## Genesis 24:56 (id: 1801024056)

56He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.”


## Genesis 24:57 (id: 1801024057)

57They said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.”


## Genesis 24:58 (id: 1801024058)

58They called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.”


## Genesis 24:59 (id: 1801024059)

59They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men.


## Genesis 24:60 (id: 1801024060)

60They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them.”


## Genesis 24:61 (id: 1801024061)

61Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.


## Genesis 24:62 (id: 1801024062)

62Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South.


## Genesis 24:63 (id: 1801024063)

63Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes and looked. Behold, there were camels coming.


## Genesis 24:64 (id: 1801024064)

64Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she got off the camel.


## Genesis 24:65 (id: 1801024065)

65She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” She took her veil, and covered herself.


## Genesis 24:66 (id: 1801024066)

66The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.


## Genesis 24:67 (id: 1801024067)

67Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.


## Genesis 25:1 (id: 1801025001)

1Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.

## Genesis 25:6 (id: 1801025006)

6but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham’s concubines. While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.


## Genesis 25:7 (id: 1801025007)

7These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy\-five years.


## Genesis 25:8 (id: 1801025008)

8Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.


## Genesis 25:9 (id: 1801025009)

9Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre,

18They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.


## Genesis 25:19 (id: 1801025019)

19This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.


## Genesis 25:20 (id: 1801025020)

20Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.


## Genesis 25:21 (id: 1801025021)

21Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. The LORD was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.


## Genesis 25:22 (id: 1801025022)

22The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I live?” She went to inquire of the LORD.


## Genesis 25:23 (id: 1801025023)

23The LORD said to her, “Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.”


## Genesis 25:24 (id: 1801025024)

24When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.


## Genesis 25:25 (id: 1801025025)

25The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.


## Genesis 25:26 (id: 1801025026)

26After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.


## Genesis 25:27 (id: 1801025027)

27The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.


## Genesis 25:28 (id: 1801025028)

28Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.


## Genesis 25:29 (id: 1801025029)

29Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.


## Genesis 25:30 (id: 1801025030)

30Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.


## Genesis 25:31 (id: 1801025031)

31Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”


## Genesis 25:32 (id: 1801025032)

32Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”


## Genesis 25:33 (id: 1801025033)

33Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.


## Genesis 25:34 (id: 1801025034)

34Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.


## Genesis 26:1 (id: 1801026001)

1There was a famine in the land, in addition to the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.


## Genesis 26:2 (id: 1801026002)

2The LORD appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.


## Genesis 26:3 (id: 1801026003)

3Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.


## Genesis 26:4 (id: 1801026004)

4I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed,


## Genesis 26:5 (id: 1801026005)

5because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”


## Genesis 26:6 (id: 1801026006)

6Isaac lived in Gerar.


## Genesis 26:7 (id: 1801026007)

7The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.”


## Genesis 26:8 (id: 1801026008)

8When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.


## Genesis 26:9 (id: 1801026009)

9Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”


## Genesis 26:10 (id: 1801026010)

10Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”


## Genesis 26:11 (id: 1801026011)

11Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”


## Genesis 26:12 (id: 1801026012)

12Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. The LORD blessed him.


## Genesis 26:13 (id: 1801026013)

13The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.


## Genesis 26:14 (id: 1801026014)

14He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.


## Genesis 26:15 (id: 1801026015)

15Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.


## Genesis 26:16 (id: 1801026016)

16Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”


## Genesis 26:17 (id: 1801026017)

17Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.


## Genesis 26:18 (id: 1801026018)

18Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.


## Genesis 26:19 (id: 1801026019)

19Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing water.


## Genesis 26:20 (id: 1801026020)

20The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.


## Genesis 26:21 (id: 1801026021)

21They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. So he called its name Sitnah.


## Genesis 26:22 (id: 1801026022)

22He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. So he called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”


## Genesis 26:23 (id: 1801026023)

23He went up from there to Beersheba.


## Genesis 26:24 (id: 1801026024)

24The LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham’s sake.”


## Genesis 26:25 (id: 1801026025)

25He built an altar there, and called on the LORD’s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well.


## Genesis 26:26 (id: 1801026026)

26Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.


## Genesis 26:27 (id: 1801026027)

27Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?”


## Genesis 26:28 (id: 1801026028)

28They said, “We saw plainly that the LORD was with you. We said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let’s make a covenant with you,


## Genesis 26:29 (id: 1801026029)

29that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of the LORD.”


## Genesis 26:30 (id: 1801026030)

30He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.


## Genesis 26:31 (id: 1801026031)

31They rose up some time in the morning, and swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.


## Genesis 26:32 (id: 1801026032)

32The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”


## Genesis 26:33 (id: 1801026033)

33He called it “Shibah”. Therefore the name of the city is “Beersheba” to this day.


## Genesis 26:34 (id: 1801026034)

34When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.


## Genesis 26:35 (id: 1801026035)

35They grieved Isaac’s and Rebekah’s spirits.


## Genesis 27:1 (id: 1801027001)

1When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son?” He said to him, “Here I am.”


## Genesis 27:2 (id: 1801027002)

2He said, “See now, I am old. I don’t know the day of my death.


## Genesis 27:3 (id: 1801027003)

3Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and get me venison.


## Genesis 27:4 (id: 1801027004)

4Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.”


## Genesis 27:5 (id: 1801027005)

5Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.


## Genesis 27:6 (id: 1801027006)

6Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,


## Genesis 27:7 (id: 1801027007)

7‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death.’


## Genesis 27:8 (id: 1801027008)

8Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.


## Genesis 27:9 (id: 1801027009)

9Go now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves.


## Genesis 27:10 (id: 1801027010)

10You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”


## Genesis 27:11 (id: 1801027011)

11Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.


## Genesis 27:12 (id: 1801027012)

12What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.”


## Genesis 27:13 (id: 1801027013)

13His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.”


## Genesis 27:14 (id: 1801027014)

14He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.


## Genesis 27:15 (id: 1801027015)

15Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.


## Genesis 27:16 (id: 1801027016)

16She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.


## Genesis 27:17 (id: 1801027017)

17She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.


## Genesis 27:18 (id: 1801027018)

18He came to his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”


## Genesis 27:19 (id: 1801027019)

19Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.”


## Genesis 27:20 (id: 1801027020)

20Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He said, “Because the LORD your God gave me success.”


## Genesis 27:21 (id: 1801027021)

21Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”


## Genesis 27:22 (id: 1801027022)

22Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”


## Genesis 27:23 (id: 1801027023)

23He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau’s hands. So he blessed him.


## Genesis 27:24 (id: 1801027024)

24He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He said, “I am.”


## Genesis 27:25 (id: 1801027025)

25He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.” He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.


## Genesis 27:26 (id: 1801027026)

26His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.”


## Genesis 27:27 (id: 1801027027)

27He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed.


## Genesis 27:28 (id: 1801027028)

28God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.


## Genesis 27:29 (id: 1801027029)

29Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers. Let your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you.”


## Genesis 27:30 (id: 1801027030)

30As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.


## Genesis 27:31 (id: 1801027031)

31He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.”


## Genesis 27:32 (id: 1801027032)

32Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”


## Genesis 27:33 (id: 1801027033)

33Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.”


## Genesis 27:34 (id: 1801027034)

34When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.”


## Genesis 27:35 (id: 1801027035)

35He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”


## Genesis 27:36 (id: 1801027036)

36He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”


## Genesis 27:37 (id: 1801027037)

37Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?”


## Genesis 27:38 (id: 1801027038)

38Esau said to his father, “Do you have just one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.


## Genesis 27:39 (id: 1801027039)

39Isaac his father answered him, “Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of the sky from above.


## Genesis 27:40 (id: 1801027040)

40You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you will shake his yoke from off your neck.”


## Genesis 27:41 (id: 1801027041)

41Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.”


## Genesis 27:42 (id: 1801027042)

42The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.


## Genesis 27:43 (id: 1801027043)

43Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.


## Genesis 27:44 (id: 1801027044)

44Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away—


## Genesis 27:45 (id: 1801027045)

45until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”


## Genesis 27:46 (id: 1801027046)

46Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”


## Genesis 28:1 (id: 1801028001)

1Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.


## Genesis 28:2 (id: 1801028002)

2Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.


## Genesis 28:3 (id: 1801028003)

3May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,


## Genesis 28:4 (id: 1801028004)

4and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.”


## Genesis 28:5 (id: 1801028005)

5Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.


## Genesis 28:6 (id: 1801028006)

6Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;”


## Genesis 28:7 (id: 1801028007)

7and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.


## Genesis 28:8 (id: 1801028008)

8Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father.


## Genesis 28:9 (id: 1801028009)

9So Esau went to Ishmael, and took, in addition to the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.


## Genesis 28:10 (id: 1801028010)

10Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.


## Genesis 28:11 (id: 1801028011)

11He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.


## Genesis 28:12 (id: 1801028012)

12He dreamed and saw a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.


## Genesis 28:13 (id: 1801028013)

13Behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. I will give the land you lie on to you and to your offspring.


## Genesis 28:14 (id: 1801028014)

14Your offspring will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed.


## Genesis 28:15 (id: 1801028015)

15Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.”


## Genesis 28:16 (id: 1801028016)

16Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I didn’t know it.”


## Genesis 28:17 (id: 1801028017)

17He was afraid, and said, “How awesome this place is! This is none other than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.”


## Genesis 28:18 (id: 1801028018)

18Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.


## Genesis 28:19 (id: 1801028019)

19He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.


## Genesis 28:20 (id: 1801028020)

20Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,


## Genesis 28:21 (id: 1801028021)

21so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and the LORD will be my God,


## Genesis 28:22 (id: 1801028022)

22then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give a tenth to you.”


## Genesis 29:1 (id: 1801029001)

1Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.


## Genesis 29:2 (id: 1801029002)

2He looked, and saw a well in the field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well’s mouth was large.


## Genesis 29:3 (id: 1801029003)

3There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back on the well’s mouth in its place.


## Genesis 29:4 (id: 1801029004)

4Jacob said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?” They said, “We are from Haran.”


## Genesis 29:5 (id: 1801029005)

5He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.”


## Genesis 29:6 (id: 1801029006)

6He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.”


## Genesis 29:7 (id: 1801029007)

7He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”


## Genesis 29:8 (id: 1801029008)

8They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we will water the sheep.”


## Genesis 29:9 (id: 1801029009)

9While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them.


## Genesis 29:10 (id: 1801029010)

10When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.


## Genesis 29:11 (id: 1801029011)

11Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.


## Genesis 29:12 (id: 1801029012)

12Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father.


## Genesis 29:13 (id: 1801029013)

13When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.


## Genesis 29:14 (id: 1801029014)

14Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” Jacob stayed with him for a month.


## Genesis 29:15 (id: 1801029015)

15Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?”


## Genesis 29:16 (id: 1801029016)

16Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.


## Genesis 29:17 (id: 1801029017)

17Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.


## Genesis 29:18 (id: 1801029018)

18Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.”


## Genesis 29:19 (id: 1801029019)

19Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”


## Genesis 29:20 (id: 1801029020)

20Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.


## Genesis 29:21 (id: 1801029021)

21Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”


## Genesis 29:22 (id: 1801029022)

22Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.


## Genesis 29:23 (id: 1801029023)

23In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He went in to her.


## Genesis 29:24 (id: 1801029024)

24Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant.


## Genesis 29:25 (id: 1801029025)

25In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”


## Genesis 29:26 (id: 1801029026)

26Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.


## Genesis 29:27 (id: 1801029027)

27Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.”


## Genesis 29:28 (id: 1801029028)

28Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.

29Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.

30He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him seven more years.


## Genesis 29:31 (id: 1801029031)

31The LORD saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.


## Genesis 29:32 (id: 1801029032)

32Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, “Because the LORD has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.”


## Genesis 29:33 (id: 1801029033)

33She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon.


## Genesis 29:34 (id: 1801029034)

34She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi.

## Genesis 30:14 (id: 1801030014)

14Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”


## Genesis 30:15 (id: 1801030015)

15Leah said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?” Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”


## Genesis 30:16 (id: 1801030016)

16Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” He lay with her that night.


## Genesis 30:17 (id: 1801030017)

21Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.


## Genesis 30:22 (id: 1801030022)

22God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.


## Genesis 30:23 (id: 1801030023)

23She conceived, bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.”


## Genesis 30:24 (id: 1801030024)

24She named him Joseph, saying, “May the LORD add another son to me.”


## Genesis 30:25 (id: 1801030025)

25When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.


## Genesis 30:26 (id: 1801030026)

26Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.”


## Genesis 30:27 (id: 1801030027)

27Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that the LORD has blessed me for your sake.”


## Genesis 30:28 (id: 1801030028)

28He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.”


## Genesis 30:29 (id: 1801030029)

29Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.


## Genesis 30:30 (id: 1801030030)

30For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. The LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?”


## Genesis 30:31 (id: 1801030031)

31Laban said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.


## Genesis 30:32 (id: 1801030032)

32I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.


## Genesis 30:33 (id: 1801030033)

33So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered stolen.”


## Genesis 30:34 (id: 1801030034)

34Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”


## Genesis 30:35 (id: 1801030035)

35That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.


## Genesis 30:36 (id: 1801030036)

36He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.


## Genesis 30:37 (id: 1801030037)

37Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, and plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.


## Genesis 30:38 (id: 1801030038)

38He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.


## Genesis 30:39 (id: 1801030039)

39The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted.


## Genesis 30:40 (id: 1801030040)

40Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in Laban’s flock. He put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban’s flock.


## Genesis 30:41 (id: 1801030041)

41Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the watering troughs, that they might conceive among the rods;


## Genesis 30:42 (id: 1801030042)

42but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.


## Genesis 30:43 (id: 1801030043)

43The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.


## Genesis 31:1 (id: 1801031001)

1Jacob heard Laban’s sons’ words, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s. He has obtained all this wealth from that which was our father’s.”


## Genesis 31:2 (id: 1801031002)

2Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.


## Genesis 31:3 (id: 1801031003)

3The LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”


## Genesis 31:4 (id: 1801031004)

4Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,


## Genesis 31:5 (id: 1801031005)

5and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.


## Genesis 31:6 (id: 1801031006)

6You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.


## Genesis 31:7 (id: 1801031007)

7Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow him to hurt me.


## Genesis 31:8 (id: 1801031008)

8If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked.


## Genesis 31:9 (id: 1801031009)

9Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me.


## Genesis 31:10 (id: 1801031010)

10During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.


## Genesis 31:11 (id: 1801031011)

11The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’


## Genesis 31:12 (id: 1801031012)

12He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.


## Genesis 31:13 (id: 1801031013)

13I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”


## Genesis 31:14 (id: 1801031014)

14Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?


## Genesis 31:15 (id: 1801031015)

15Aren’t we considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and has also used up our money.


## Genesis 31:16 (id: 1801031016)

16For all the riches which God has taken away from our father are ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”


## Genesis 31:17 (id: 1801031017)

17Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,


## Genesis 31:18 (id: 1801031018)

18and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.


## Genesis 31:19 (id: 1801031019)

19Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.


## Genesis 31:20 (id: 1801031020)

20Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away.


## Genesis 31:21 (id: 1801031021)

21So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.


## Genesis 31:22 (id: 1801031022)

22Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.


## Genesis 31:23 (id: 1801031023)

23He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.


## Genesis 31:24 (id: 1801031024)

24God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.”


## Genesis 31:25 (id: 1801031025)

25Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.


## Genesis 31:26 (id: 1801031026)

26Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?


## Genesis 31:27 (id: 1801031027)

27Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;


## Genesis 31:28 (id: 1801031028)

28and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.


## Genesis 31:29 (id: 1801031029)

29It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’


## Genesis 31:30 (id: 1801031030)

30Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?”


## Genesis 31:31 (id: 1801031031)

31Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’


## Genesis 31:32 (id: 1801031032)

32Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.


## Genesis 31:33 (id: 1801031033)

33Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.


## Genesis 31:34 (id: 1801031034)

34Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them.


## Genesis 31:35 (id: 1801031035)

35She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the teraphim.


## Genesis 31:36 (id: 1801031036)

36Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?


## Genesis 31:37 (id: 1801031037)

37Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.


## Genesis 31:38 (id: 1801031038)

38“These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks.


## Genesis 31:39 (id: 1801031039)

39That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.


## Genesis 31:40 (id: 1801031040)

40This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.


## Genesis 31:41 (id: 1801031041)

41These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.


## Genesis 31:42 (id: 1801031042)

42Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”


## Genesis 31:43 (id: 1801031043)

43Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?


## Genesis 31:44 (id: 1801031044)

44Now come, let’s make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness between me and you.”


## Genesis 31:45 (id: 1801031045)

45Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.


## Genesis 31:46 (id: 1801031046)

46Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.


## Genesis 31:47 (id: 1801031047)

47Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.


## Genesis 31:48 (id: 1801031048)

48Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore it was named Galeed


## Genesis 31:49 (id: 1801031049)

49and Mizpah, for he said, “The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.


## Genesis 31:50 (id: 1801031050)

50If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.”


## Genesis 31:51 (id: 1801031051)

51Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.


## Genesis 31:52 (id: 1801031052)

52May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.


## Genesis 31:53 (id: 1801031053)

53The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.


## Genesis 31:54 (id: 1801031054)

54Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.


## Genesis 31:55 (id: 1801031055)

55Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.


## Genesis 32:1 (id: 1801032001)

1Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.


## Genesis 32:2 (id: 1801032002)

2When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim.


## Genesis 32:3 (id: 1801032003)

3Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.


## Genesis 32:4 (id: 1801032004)

4He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.


## Genesis 32:5 (id: 1801032005)

5I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.’”


## Genesis 32:6 (id: 1801032006)

6The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”


## Genesis 32:7 (id: 1801032007)

7Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two companies.


## Genesis 32:8 (id: 1801032008)

8He said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.”


## Genesis 32:9 (id: 1801032009)

9Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’


## Genesis 32:10 (id: 1801032010)

10I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.


## Genesis 32:11 (id: 1801032011)

11Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children.


## Genesis 32:12 (id: 1801032012)

12You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’”


## Genesis 32:13 (id: 1801032013)

13He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother:


## Genesis 32:14 (id: 1801032014)

14two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,


## Genesis 32:15 (id: 1801032015)

15thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.


## Genesis 32:16 (id: 1801032016)

16He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.”


## Genesis 32:17 (id: 1801032017)

17He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’


## Genesis 32:18 (id: 1801032018)

18Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’”


## Genesis 32:19 (id: 1801032019)

19He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.


## Genesis 32:20 (id: 1801032020)

20You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”


## Genesis 32:21 (id: 1801032021)

21So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.


## Genesis 32:22 (id: 1801032022)

22He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.


## Genesis 32:23 (id: 1801032023)

23He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.


## Genesis 32:24 (id: 1801032024)

24Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.


## Genesis 32:25 (id: 1801032025)

25When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained as he wrestled.


## Genesis 32:26 (id: 1801032026)

26The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.” Jacob said, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.”


## Genesis 32:27 (id: 1801032027)

27He said to him, “What is your name?” He said, “Jacob”.


## Genesis 32:28 (id: 1801032028)

28He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.”


## Genesis 32:29 (id: 1801032029)

29Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” So he blessed him there.


## Genesis 32:30 (id: 1801032030)

30Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”


## Genesis 32:31 (id: 1801032031)

31The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.


## Genesis 32:32 (id: 1801032032)

32Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.


## Genesis 33:1 (id: 1801033001)

1Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants.


## Genesis 33:2 (id: 1801033002)

2He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.


## Genesis 33:3 (id: 1801033003)

3He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.


## Genesis 33:4 (id: 1801033004)

4Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.


## Genesis 33:5 (id: 1801033005)

5He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?” He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”


## Genesis 33:6 (id: 1801033006)

6Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.


## Genesis 33:7 (id: 1801033007)

7Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.


## Genesis 33:8 (id: 1801033008)

8Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” Jacob said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”


## Genesis 33:9 (id: 1801033009)

9Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”


## Genesis 33:10 (id: 1801033010)

10Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.


## Genesis 33:11 (id: 1801033011)

11Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.


## Genesis 33:12 (id: 1801033012)

12Esau said, “Let’s take our journey, and let’s go, and I will go before you.”


## Genesis 33:13 (id: 1801033013)

13Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.


## Genesis 33:14 (id: 1801033014)

14Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.”


## Genesis 33:15 (id: 1801033015)

15Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me.” He said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”


## Genesis 33:16 (id: 1801033016)

16So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.

1Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.


## Genesis 34:2 (id: 1801034002)

2Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.


## Genesis 34:3 (id: 1801034003)

3His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.


## Genesis 34:4 (id: 1801034004)

4Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”


## Genesis 34:5 (id: 1801034005)

5Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.


## Genesis 34:6 (id: 1801034006)

6Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.


## Genesis 34:7 (id: 1801034007)

7The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing that ought not to be done.


## Genesis 34:8 (id: 1801034008)

8Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.


## Genesis 34:9 (id: 1801034009)

9Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.

10You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.”


## Genesis 34:11 (id: 1801034011)

11Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.


## Genesis 34:12 (id: 1801034012)

12Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.”


## Genesis 34:13 (id: 1801034013)

13The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit when they spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,


## Genesis 34:14 (id: 1801034014)

14and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.


## Genesis 34:15 (id: 1801034015)

15Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised,


## Genesis 34:16 (id: 1801034016)

16then will we give our daughters to you; and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.


## Genesis 34:17 (id: 1801034017)

17But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone.”


## Genesis 34:18 (id: 1801034018)

18Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.


## Genesis 34:19 (id: 1801034019)

19The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.


## Genesis 34:20 (id: 1801034020)

20Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,


## Genesis 34:21 (id: 1801034021)

21“These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let’s take their daughters to us for wives, and let’s give them our daughters.


## Genesis 34:22 (id: 1801034022)

22Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.


## Genesis 34:23 (id: 1801034023)

23Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let’s give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”


## Genesis 34:24 (id: 1801034024)

24All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.


## Genesis 34:25 (id: 1801034025)

29and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.


## Genesis 34:30 (id: 1801034030)

30Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.”

2Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments.


## Genesis 35:3 (id: 1801035003)

3Let’s arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.”

28Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. The merchants brought Joseph into Egypt.


## Genesis 37:29 (id: 1801037029)

29Reuben returned to the pit, and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore his clothes.


## Genesis 37:30 (id: 1801037030)

30He returned to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?”


## Genesis 37:31 (id: 1801037031)

31They took Joseph’s tunic, and killed a male goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood.


## Genesis 37:32 (id: 1801037032)

32They took the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found this. Examine it, now, and see if it is your son’s tunic or not.”


## Genesis 37:33 (id: 1801037033)

33He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s tunic. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.”


## Genesis 37:34 (id: 1801037034)

34Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days.


## Genesis 37:35 (id: 1801037035)

35All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” His father wept for him.


## Genesis 37:36 (id: 1801037036)

36The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.


## Genesis 38:1 (id: 1801038001)

1At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.


## Genesis 38:2 (id: 1801038002)

2There, Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite man named Shua. He took her, and went in to her.


## Genesis 38:3 (id: 1801038003)

3She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er.


## Genesis 38:4 (id: 1801038004)

4She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.


## Genesis 38:5 (id: 1801038005)

5She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.


## Genesis 38:6 (id: 1801038006)

6Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.


## Genesis 38:7 (id: 1801038007)

7Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the LORD’s sight. So the LORD killed him.


## Genesis 38:8 (id: 1801038008)

8Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”


## Genesis 38:9 (id: 1801038009)

9Onan knew that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother.


## Genesis 38:10 (id: 1801038010)

10The thing which he did was evil in the LORD’s sight, and he killed him also.


## Genesis 38:11 (id: 1801038011)

11Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter\-in\-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;” for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.


## Genesis 38:12 (id: 1801038012)

12After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.


## Genesis 38:13 (id: 1801038013)

13Tamar was told, “Behold, your father\-in\-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”


## Genesis 38:14 (id: 1801038014)

14She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife.


## Genesis 38:15 (id: 1801038015)

15When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.


## Genesis 38:16 (id: 1801038016)

16He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter\-in\-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”


## Genesis 38:17 (id: 1801038017)

17He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”


## Genesis 38:18 (id: 1801038018)

18He said, “What pledge will I give you?” She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.


## Genesis 38:19 (id: 1801038019)

19She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.


## Genesis 38:20 (id: 1801038020)

20Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her.


## Genesis 38:21 (id: 1801038021)

21Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?” They said, “There has been no prostitute here.”


## Genesis 38:22 (id: 1801038022)

22He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’”


## Genesis 38:23 (id: 1801038023)

23Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.”


## Genesis 38:24 (id: 1801038024)

24About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter\-in\-law, has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.” Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”


## Genesis 38:25 (id: 1801038025)

25When she was brought out, she sent to her father\-in\-law, saying, “I am with child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose these are—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.”


## Genesis 38:26 (id: 1801038026)

26Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.” He knew her again no more.


## Genesis 38:27 (id: 1801038027)

27In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb.


## Genesis 38:28 (id: 1801038028)

28When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.”


## Genesis 38:29 (id: 1801038029)

29As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez.


## Genesis 38:30 (id: 1801038030)

30Afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.


## Genesis 39:1 (id: 1801039001)

1Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.


## Genesis 39:2 (id: 1801039002)

2The LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.


## Genesis 39:3 (id: 1801039003)

3His master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did prosper in his hand.


## Genesis 39:4 (id: 1801039004)

4Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.


## Genesis 39:5 (id: 1801039005)

5From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. The LORD’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.


## Genesis 39:6 (id: 1801039006)

6He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. Joseph was well\-built and handsome.


## Genesis 39:7 (id: 1801039007)

7After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”


## Genesis 39:8 (id: 1801039008)

8But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.


## Genesis 39:9 (id: 1801039009)

9No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”


## Genesis 39:10 (id: 1801039010)

10As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.


## Genesis 39:11 (id: 1801039011)

11About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.


## Genesis 39:12 (id: 1801039012)

12She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.


## Genesis 39:13 (id: 1801039013)

13When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,


## Genesis 39:14 (id: 1801039014)

14she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.


## Genesis 39:15 (id: 1801039015)

15When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”


## Genesis 39:16 (id: 1801039016)

16She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.


## Genesis 39:17 (id: 1801039017)

17She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,


## Genesis 39:18 (id: 1801039018)

18and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”


## Genesis 39:19 (id: 1801039019)

19When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled.


## Genesis 39:20 (id: 1801039020)

20Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.


## Genesis 39:21 (id: 1801039021)

21But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.


## Genesis 39:22 (id: 1801039022)

22The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.


## Genesis 39:23 (id: 1801039023)

23The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because the LORD was with him; and that which he did, the LORD made it prosper.


## Genesis 40:1 (id: 1801040001)

1After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt.


## Genesis 40:2 (id: 1801040002)

2Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker.


## Genesis 40:3 (id: 1801040003)

3He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.


## Genesis 40:4 (id: 1801040004)

4The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days.


## Genesis 40:5 (id: 1801040005)

5They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.


## Genesis 40:6 (id: 1801040006)

6Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.


## Genesis 40:7 (id: 1801040007)

7He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?”


## Genesis 40:8 (id: 1801040008)

8They said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.” Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.”


## Genesis 40:9 (id: 1801040009)

9The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,


## Genesis 40:10 (id: 1801040010)

10and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.


## Genesis 40:11 (id: 1801040011)

11Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”


## Genesis 40:12 (id: 1801040012)

12Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.


## Genesis 40:13 (id: 1801040013)

13Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer.


## Genesis 40:14 (id: 1801040014)

14But remember me when it is well with you. Please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.


## Genesis 40:15 (id: 1801040015)

15For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”


## Genesis 40:16 (id: 1801040016)

16When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.


## Genesis 40:17 (id: 1801040017)

17In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.”


## Genesis 40:18 (id: 1801040018)

18Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days.


## Genesis 40:19 (id: 1801040019)

19Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.”


## Genesis 40:20 (id: 1801040020)

20On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.


## Genesis 40:21 (id: 1801040021)

21He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;


## Genesis 40:22 (id: 1801040022)

22but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.


## Genesis 40:23 (id: 1801040023)

23Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him.


## Genesis 41:1 (id: 1801041001)

1At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the river.


## Genesis 41:2 (id: 1801041002)

2Behold, seven cattle came up out of the river. They were sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass.


## Genesis 41:3 (id: 1801041003)

3Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river.


## Genesis 41:4 (id: 1801041004)

4The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.


## Genesis 41:5 (id: 1801041005)

5He slept and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.


## Genesis 41:6 (id: 1801041006)

6Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.


## Genesis 41:7 (id: 1801041007)

7The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.


## Genesis 41:8 (id: 1801041008)

8In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.


## Genesis 41:9 (id: 1801041009)

9Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults today.


## Genesis 41:10 (id: 1801041010)

10Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, with the chief baker.


## Genesis 41:11 (id: 1801041011)

11We dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each man dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.


## Genesis 41:12 (id: 1801041012)

12There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man according to his dream.


## Genesis 41:13 (id: 1801041013)

13As he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”


## Genesis 41:14 (id: 1801041014)

14Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.


## Genesis 41:15 (id: 1801041015)

15Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”


## Genesis 41:16 (id: 1801041016)

16Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”


## Genesis 41:17 (id: 1801041017)

17Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river;


## Genesis 41:18 (id: 1801041018)

18and behold, seven fat and sleek cattle came up out of the river. They fed in the marsh grass;


## Genesis 41:19 (id: 1801041019)

19and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.


## Genesis 41:20 (id: 1801041020)

20The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle;


## Genesis 41:21 (id: 1801041021)

21and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.


## Genesis 41:22 (id: 1801041022)

22I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good;


## Genesis 41:23 (id: 1801041023)

23and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.


## Genesis 41:24 (id: 1801041024)

24The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”


## Genesis 41:25 (id: 1801041025)

25Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.


## Genesis 41:26 (id: 1801041026)

26The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one.


## Genesis 41:27 (id: 1801041027)

27The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.


## Genesis 41:28 (id: 1801041028)

28That is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.


## Genesis 41:29 (id: 1801041029)

29Behold, seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt are coming.


## Genesis 41:30 (id: 1801041030)

30Seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,


## Genesis 41:31 (id: 1801041031)

31and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.


## Genesis 41:32 (id: 1801041032)

32The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.


## Genesis 41:33 (id: 1801041033)

33“Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.


## Genesis 41:34 (id: 1801041034)

34Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years.


## Genesis 41:35 (id: 1801041035)

35Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and store grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.


## Genesis 41:36 (id: 1801041036)

36The food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through the famine.”


## Genesis 41:37 (id: 1801041037)

37The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.


## Genesis 41:38 (id: 1801041038)

38Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”


## Genesis 41:39 (id: 1801041039)

39Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.


## Genesis 41:40 (id: 1801041040)

40You shall be over my house. All my people will be ruled according to your word. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.”


## Genesis 41:41 (id: 1801041041)

41Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”


## Genesis 41:42 (id: 1801041042)

42Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.


## Genesis 41:43 (id: 1801041043)

43He made him ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt.


## Genesis 41:44 (id: 1801041044)

44Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you, no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.”


## Genesis 41:45 (id: 1801041045)

45Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath\-Paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.


## Genesis 41:46 (id: 1801041046)

46Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.


## Genesis 41:47 (id: 1801041047)

47In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.


## Genesis 41:48 (id: 1801041048)

48He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. He stored food in each city from the fields around that city.


## Genesis 41:49 (id: 1801041049)

49Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.


## Genesis 41:50 (id: 1801041050)

50To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.


## Genesis 41:51 (id: 1801041051)

51Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, “For”, he said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.”

53The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end.


## Genesis 41:54 (id: 1801041054)

54The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.


## Genesis 41:55 (id: 1801041055)

55When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”


## Genesis 41:56 (id: 1801041056)

56The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.


## Genesis 41:57 (id: 1801041057)

57All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.


## Genesis 42:1 (id: 1801042001)

1Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”


## Genesis 42:2 (id: 1801042002)

2He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.”


## Genesis 42:3 (id: 1801042003)

3Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.


## Genesis 42:4 (id: 1801042004)

4But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.”


## Genesis 42:5 (id: 1801042005)

5The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.


## Genesis 42:6 (id: 1801042006)

6Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.


## Genesis 42:7 (id: 1801042007)

7Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?” They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”


## Genesis 42:8 (id: 1801042008)

8Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him.


## Genesis 42:9 (id: 1801042009)

9Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.”


## Genesis 42:10 (id: 1801042010)

10They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.


## Genesis 42:11 (id: 1801042011)

11We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”


## Genesis 42:12 (id: 1801042012)

12He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”


## Genesis 42:13 (id: 1801042013)

13They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”


## Genesis 42:14 (id: 1801042014)

14Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’


## Genesis 42:15 (id: 1801042015)

15By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.


## Genesis 42:16 (id: 1801042016)

16Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.”


## Genesis 42:17 (id: 1801042017)

17He put them all together into custody for three days.


## Genesis 42:18 (id: 1801042018)

18Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God.


## Genesis 42:19 (id: 1801042019)

19If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.


## Genesis 42:20 (id: 1801042020)

20Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.” They did so.


## Genesis 42:21 (id: 1801042021)

21They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.”


## Genesis 42:22 (id: 1801042022)

22Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.”


## Genesis 42:23 (id: 1801042023)

23They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.


## Genesis 42:24 (id: 1801042024)

24He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.


## Genesis 42:25 (id: 1801042025)

25Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.


## Genesis 42:26 (id: 1801042026)

26They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.


## Genesis 42:27 (id: 1801042027)

27As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.


## Genesis 42:28 (id: 1801042028)

28He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”


## Genesis 42:29 (id: 1801042029)

29They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,


## Genesis 42:30 (id: 1801042030)

30“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.


## Genesis 42:31 (id: 1801042031)

31We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies.


## Genesis 42:32 (id: 1801042032)

32We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’


## Genesis 42:33 (id: 1801042033)

33The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.


## Genesis 42:34 (id: 1801042034)

34Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”


## Genesis 42:35 (id: 1801042035)

35As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.


## Genesis 42:36 (id: 1801042036)

36Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”


## Genesis 42:37 (id: 1801042037)

37Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”


## Genesis 42:38 (id: 1801042038)

38He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”


## Genesis 43:1 (id: 1801043001)

1The famine was severe in the land.


## Genesis 43:2 (id: 1801043002)

2When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”


## Genesis 43:3 (id: 1801043003)

3Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’


## Genesis 43:4 (id: 1801043004)

4If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food;


## Genesis 43:5 (id: 1801043005)

5but if you don’t send him, we won’t go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’”


## Genesis 43:6 (id: 1801043006)

6Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”


## Genesis 43:7 (id: 1801043007)

7They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”


## Genesis 43:8 (id: 1801043008)

8Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.


## Genesis 43:9 (id: 1801043009)

9I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever;


## Genesis 43:10 (id: 1801043010)

10for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.”


## Genesis 43:11 (id: 1801043011)

11Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;


## Genesis 43:12 (id: 1801043012)

12and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.


## Genesis 43:13 (id: 1801043013)

13Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.


## Genesis 43:14 (id: 1801043014)

14May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”


## Genesis 43:15 (id: 1801043015)

15The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.


## Genesis 43:16 (id: 1801043016)

16When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.”


## Genesis 43:17 (id: 1801043017)

17The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.


## Genesis 43:18 (id: 1801043018)

18The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”


## Genesis 43:19 (id: 1801043019)

19They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,


## Genesis 43:20 (id: 1801043020)

20and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.


## Genesis 43:21 (id: 1801043021)

21When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.


## Genesis 43:22 (id: 1801043022)

22We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”


## Genesis 43:23 (id: 1801043023)

23He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them.


## Genesis 43:24 (id: 1801043024)

24The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.


## Genesis 43:25 (id: 1801043025)

25They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.


## Genesis 43:26 (id: 1801043026)

26When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to the earth before him.


## Genesis 43:27 (id: 1801043027)

27He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?”


## Genesis 43:28 (id: 1801043028)

28They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly.


## Genesis 43:29 (id: 1801043029)

29He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”


## Genesis 43:30 (id: 1801043030)

30Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.


## Genesis 43:31 (id: 1801043031)

31He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”


## Genesis 43:32 (id: 1801043032)

32They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.


## Genesis 43:33 (id: 1801043033)

33They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled with one another.


## Genesis 43:34 (id: 1801043034)

34He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.


## Genesis 44:1 (id: 1801044001)

1He commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth.


## Genesis 44:2 (id: 1801044002)

2Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.


## Genesis 44:3 (id: 1801044003)

3As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.


## Genesis 44:4 (id: 1801044004)

4When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good?


## Genesis 44:5 (id: 1801044005)

5Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’”


## Genesis 44:6 (id: 1801044006)

6He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.


## Genesis 44:7 (id: 1801044007)

7They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!


## Genesis 44:8 (id: 1801044008)

8Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?


## Genesis 44:9 (id: 1801044009)

9With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”


## Genesis 44:10 (id: 1801044010)

10He said, “Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.”


## Genesis 44:11 (id: 1801044011)

11Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.


## Genesis 44:12 (id: 1801044012)

12He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.


## Genesis 44:13 (id: 1801044013)

13Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.


## Genesis 44:14 (id: 1801044014)

14Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him.


## Genesis 44:15 (id: 1801044015)

15Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can indeed do divination?”


## Genesis 44:16 (id: 1801044016)

16Judah said, “What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? How will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found.”


## Genesis 44:17 (id: 1801044017)

17He said, “Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”


## Genesis 44:18 (id: 1801044018)

18Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.


## Genesis 44:19 (id: 1801044019)

19My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’


## Genesis 44:20 (id: 1801044020)

20We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.’


## Genesis 44:21 (id: 1801044021)

21You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’


## Genesis 44:22 (id: 1801044022)

22We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’


## Genesis 44:23 (id: 1801044023)

23You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.’


## Genesis 44:24 (id: 1801044024)

24When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.


## Genesis 44:25 (id: 1801044025)

25Our father said, ‘Go again and buy us a little food.’


## Genesis 44:26 (id: 1801044026)

26We said, ‘We can’t go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’


## Genesis 44:27 (id: 1801044027)

27Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.


## Genesis 44:28 (id: 1801044028)

28One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces;” and I haven’t seen him since.


## Genesis 44:29 (id: 1801044029)

29If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.’


## Genesis 44:30 (id: 1801044030)

30Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life;


## Genesis 44:31 (id: 1801044031)

31it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.


## Genesis 44:32 (id: 1801044032)

32For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I don’t bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.’


## Genesis 44:33 (id: 1801044033)

33Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers.


## Genesis 44:34 (id: 1801044034)

34For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn’t with me?—lest I see the evil that will come on my father.”


## Genesis 45:1 (id: 1801045001)

1Then Joseph couldn’t control himself before all those who stood before him, and he called out, “Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.


## Genesis 45:2 (id: 1801045002)

2He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.


## Genesis 45:3 (id: 1801045003)

3Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Does my father still live?” His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.


## Genesis 45:4 (id: 1801045004)

4Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” They came near. He said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.


## Genesis 45:5 (id: 1801045005)

5Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.


## Genesis 45:6 (id: 1801045006)

6For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be no plowing and no harvest.


## Genesis 45:7 (id: 1801045007)

7God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.


## Genesis 45:8 (id: 1801045008)

8So now it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.


## Genesis 45:9 (id: 1801045009)

9Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t wait.


## Genesis 45:10 (id: 1801045010)

10You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.


## Genesis 45:11 (id: 1801045011)

11There I will provide for you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.”’


## Genesis 45:12 (id: 1801045012)

12Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.


## Genesis 45:13 (id: 1801045013)

13You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.”


## Genesis 45:14 (id: 1801045014)

14He fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.


## Genesis 45:15 (id: 1801045015)

15He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.


## Genesis 45:16 (id: 1801045016)

16The report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.


## Genesis 45:17 (id: 1801045017)

17Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan.


## Genesis 45:18 (id: 1801045018)

18Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’


## Genesis 45:19 (id: 1801045019)

19Now you are commanded to do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.


## Genesis 45:20 (id: 1801045020)

20Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.”


## Genesis 45:21 (id: 1801045021)

21The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.


## Genesis 45:22 (id: 1801045022)

22He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.


## Genesis 45:23 (id: 1801045023)

## Genesis 47:12 (id: 1801047012)

12Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household with bread, according to the sizes of their families.


## Genesis 47:13 (id: 1801047013)

13There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.


## Genesis 47:14 (id: 1801047014)

14Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.


## Genesis 47:15 (id: 1801047015)

## Genesis 47:18 (id: 1801047018)

18When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.


## Genesis 47:19 (id: 1801047019)

19Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”


## Genesis 47:20 (id: 1801047020)

20So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s.


## Genesis 47:21 (id: 1801047021)

21As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.


## Genesis 47:22 (id: 1801047022)

22Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their land.


## Genesis 47:23 (id: 1801047023)

23Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.


## Genesis 47:24 (id: 1801047024)

25They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”


## Genesis 47:26 (id: 1801047026)

26Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.


## Genesis 47:27 (id: 1801047027)

27Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.

28Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty\-seven years.


## Genesis 47:29 (id: 1801047029)

29The time came near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt,


## Genesis 47:30 (id: 1801047030)

4and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’


## Genesis 48:5 (id: 1801048005)

6Your offspring, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.

11Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.”


## Genesis 48:12 (id: 1801048012)

12Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.


## Genesis 48:13 (id: 1801048013)

13Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.


## Genesis 48:14 (id: 1801048014)

14Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.


## Genesis 48:15 (id: 1801048015)

15He blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,

16the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.”


## Genesis 48:17 (id: 1801048017)

17When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.


## Genesis 48:18 (id: 1801048018)

18Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”

## Genesis 48:20 (id: 1801048020)
